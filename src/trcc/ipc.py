"""IPC for the next/ daemon — manifold dispatch over a Unix socket.

The daemon (`trcc daemon`) owns one ``App`` and serves requests
through ``IPCServer``.  Clients (``AppProxy`` returned by
``_boot.trcc()`` when ``TRCC_DAEMON=1``) call ``dispatch(cmd)``
and the proxy turns each call into one socket round-trip.

Wire format — one line of JSON per request.

  Dispatch::

      {"command": "SendColor",
       "kwargs": {"key": "0402:3922", "r": 255, "g": 0, "b": 0}}

  Control::

      {"kill": true}

The dispatcher looks ``command`` up in the Command registry, builds the
dataclass via type-hint-driven coercion (str → Path, list → tuple, dict
→ nested dataclass, int → Enum), invokes ``app.dispatch(cmd)``, and
serializes the returned Result back as::

      {"type": "SendResult", "ok": true,
       "message": "Sent 204800 bytes (#ff0000)",
       "key": "0402:3922", "bytes_sent": 204800}

The serialization is reflective over ``dataclasses.fields`` so adding a
new Command + Result is zero-touch for IPC.

Events travel the same way on a subscription stream::

      {"event": "FrameSent",
       "fields": {"key": "0402:3922", "bytes_sent": 204800,
                  "surface": null, "display_colors": []}}

Bytes are encoded as ``{"__bytes__": "<base64>"}`` so binary payloads
(``SendFrame``) survive JSON.  ``Path`` survives as ``str(path)``.

    ``typing.get_type_hints`` is the single most expensive thing on the IPC
    path, and it is expensive here for a reason specific to this codebase:
    every module uses ``from __future__ import annotations``, so every
    annotation is a STRING that has to be ``eval``'d back into a type.  CPython
    does that through ``ForwardRef._evaluate`` -> ``compile()``, and ``compile``
    is one of the most costly calls in the interpreter.

    Measured 2026-09-08 on the mock daemon, ``ListDevices`` dispatched through
    a real socket, ``perf stat -e instructions:u`` over both processes,
    differential (N=5000 minus N=1000) so start-up cancels:

    ==========================  ===========  =========
    per dispatch                before       after
    ==========================  ===========  =========
    ``compile()`` calls         19           0
    instructions                2,456,030    839,134
    ==========================  ===========  =========

    **66%.**  A client-only prototype predicted 53%; the extra comes from the
    DAEMON also decoding every Command with the same cache, which the
    prototype could not patch.  Both halves of the round trip pay this cost,
    so both halves save it.  The saving scales with nesting -- ``decode_result``
    on a 200-entry list went 8.24 ms -> 1.33 ms.

    Never measure this with CPU% or wall time: this box scales its clock, and
    replicate spread on wall time was 53% against <0.4% on instructions.

    Caching is safe because a dataclass's annotations are fixed at import: the
    only keys are the ~279 Command / Result / Event classes in the registries,
    all module-level singletons, so the cache is bounded and its strong
    references cost nothing.  A concurrent miss may resolve twice, which is
    idempotent.  Gated by ``tests/test_ipc_wire.py``, which round-trips every
    registered type -- 279/279 identical with the cache on and off.

class SingleInstance:
    """Per-UI socket-based single-instance + raise-existing-window helper.

    The first launch of ``trcc gui`` binds ``~/.cache/trcc/gui.sock``
    and listens for ``{"raise": true}`` messages.  Subsequent launches
    fail to bind, instead connect to the existing socket, send
    ``{"raise": true}``, and bail out — the running window's
    :attr:`on_raise` callback fires on this helper's **accept thread**
    (not the Qt main thread).  The consumer is therefore responsible for
    marshalling any GUI work onto the main thread: the legacy GUI wires
    ``on_raise`` to a Qt signal whose slot is connected with
    ``QueuedConnection`` (see ``ui/gui/__init__.py``).

    Architectural note: this is separate from the daemon's
    :class:`IPCServer` (which serves Command dispatch).  Each UI type
    (``gui`` / ``qtgui`` / future REPL) gets its own socket so two
    different UIs can coexist while still enforcing one of each.
