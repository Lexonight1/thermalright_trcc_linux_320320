    contract written four times.  They are also not an arbitrary pair: they mark
    exactly the sources that come in PLURALS.  :class:`CpuSource` and
    :class:`MemorySource` are singular and declare neither.

    That line matters because plural is precisely what a user can CHOOSE

    Each OS fills it the way it already fills the role ports; no adapter
    changes, because every implementation already provides both members.

    **This overrides secondary finding #1 of
    ``feedback_one_shared_sensorsource_abc`` — NOT its prohibition.**  That memo

    ``{key, name}`` — which is the memo's own ``IdentifiedSource`` proposal, and
    it carries the memo's own name so the two can never be mistaken for each
    other.

    Finding #1 weighed it as "saves ~8 trivial properties, adds a layer" and
    judged it not worth it.  Two things it did not weigh: CLAUDE.md's own DRY
    threshold — *"3+ duplicates = centralize"* — which is met at FOUR; and
    :func:`_resolve_preferred`, which did not exist then, so nothing needed a

    offline, and must never trigger a refresh under the user.

    An export is ffmpeg over every frame of a clip up to five minutes

    **30 s**, so a Command that encoded inline could not survive daemon
    mode at all -- the socket would give up twenty times before ffmpeg
    did.  Submitting instead lets ``ExportVideoClip`` return a token
    immediately, and the work reports itself on the EventBus as
    ``VideoExportProgress`` / ``VideoExportFinished``.

    That is also what makes video export a capability of the app rather
    than of a window: both Qt skins used to own a private QThread each --
    two copies of the same encode, invisible to the CLI and the API and
    to any second client of one daemon.

    Serialized on purpose.  Two concurrent ffmpeg runs over the same
    machine finish no sooner together than in turn and make the UI's
    progress meaningless, so a second submission queues.
