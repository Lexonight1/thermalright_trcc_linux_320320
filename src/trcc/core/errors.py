    A ``TransportError`` because that is what it is: the socket to the process
    that owns USB is gone.  It is raised rather than returned as a
    ``Result(ok=False)`` for a measured reason — ``DiscoverResult(ok=False)``
    carries ``products=[]``, and **198 of 492 dispatch sites never check
    ``.ok``**, so a Result would render "no devices found" on a screen whose
    daemon just died.  Raising cannot be silently ignored.

    This is not a new failure mode: a dead daemon already raised, as a bare
    ``ConnectionRefusedError`` / ``TimeoutError`` with no indication of what
    the app was even talking to.  This gives that raise a name.

class RemoteCommandError(TrccError):

    In-process, a Command that raises propagates to the caller.  Over the

    one client's bad Command cannot be allowed to kill the daemon) and used to
    answer with a BASE ``Result``, which decodes to ``Result(ok=False)`` and
    then throws ``AttributeError: 'Result' object has no attribute 'devices'``
    the moment the caller reads the field it asked for.  Verified end to end.

    So the failure was never survivable — it was just illegible.  Re-raising

    message names the original exception instead of a missing attribute.
