    Personalizing here is what makes the preview agree with the glass.

    ``encode`` selects what the caller gets back, because that is the only
    thing the four differed by:

      * ``""``    — surface only.  No encode cost; the Qt skins render it.
      * ``"png"`` — lossless bytes; overlay text + CJK glyphs stay legible.
      * ``"jpeg"``— lossy bytes for streaming, where a PNG per frame would
        burn the bandwidth.

    ``sample_cols`` additionally returns a row-major RGB grid, sized from the
    surface's own aspect ratio, for terminal previews.  The surface always
    comes back too when it exists — it is the thing that was built.

    Polled by preview panels, so logged at DEBUG.

    Separate from ``StartScreencast`` on purpose.  ``StartScreencast`` only

    subscribes to it and runs its own 150 ms timer — so a GUI session already
    has a driver.  Registering one there too would put TWO capture loops on the
    same wire for anyone using the window.

    So the driver is opt-in, and the clients without a timer of their own — the
    CLI, the REST route, the daemon — ask for it explicitly.  That leaves two
    drivers in the tree, which is honest rather than ideal: the end state is one
    driver here and no timer in the GUI, and what blocks it is the GUI's audio
    spectrum, which needs a ``Renderer`` rectangle primitive before it can move
    out of the window.

    Idempotent — the scheduler replaces a task registered under the same key.

    ``interval_s`` defaults to the gui's own screencast cadence so a headless
    cast moves at the same rate as one driven from the window.  It is a field

    Qt skins reached past the bus for the answer (one through an App method,
    one by importing the service outright) and cli/api simply had no way to
    find out what a device is displaying.

    Every element comes back with an id, minted positionally where a theme
    supplied none — see ``services.overlay.effective_overlay_layout``.  That
    id is what :class:`FlashOverlayElement` and
    :class:`UpdateOverlayElement` take, and both resolve through the same
    helper, so an id handed to a UI here is addressable there.

    Always ``ok=True``.  An empty layout is a normal answer, not a failure —
    a device with no theme loaded genuinely has nothing on screen, and
    ``ok=False`` escalates to WARNING through ``App.dispatch``, which would
    warn on every poll of a device sitting at its pre-load state.  Callers
    distinguish the empty answers with :attr:`~OverlayLayoutResult.source`
    and :attr:`~OverlayLayoutResult.enabled`.

    UI holding the Device, and ``app.devices`` is absent on the ``AppProxy`` a
    daemon-mode UI holds, so all 25 of those sites raised under
    ``TRCC_DAEMON=1`` (#249).

    **This answers about ATTACHED devices only.**  A key that is not attached
    is ``ok=False``, whether or not the product registry knows it — the

    An ATTACHED device is ``ok=True``, and ``connected`` then says whether the

    answered: absence is a normal answer for a panel we have not talked to
    yet, and ``resolution=None`` is deliberately distinct from a 0x0 panel.

    This docstring previously promised that "a KNOWN but unconnected device is
    ``ok=True, connected=False``", read naturally as registry-known.  It never
    did that — ``app.devices`` holds attached devices, and the one branch here

    the resolution route falls back to 0x0), so the PROMISE was the defect.
