    """Save the device's CURRENT rendered state as a new theme directory.

    Distinct from "duplicate the source theme" — the cloud background,
    cloud/user mask, user overlay edits, and mask-DC layout all live
    in :class:`DeviceSettings`, not in the active theme's directory.
    A pure ``shutil.copytree`` of the source dir would lose every one
    of those.  Instead the saved theme is a **reference manifest** —
    granular assets live once in the user library and the theme points
    at them by path, so identical backgrounds/masks dedup across themes:

      * ``trcc.json`` — the manifest.  ``elements`` inlines the final
        baked overlay layout (mask layout REPLACES the theme's elements
        when a mask override carries one, then user overlay edits are
        appended — same precedence the old ``config1.dc`` bake used).
        ``background`` / ``mask`` carry library refs
        (``web/{w}{h}/<hash>.png`` / ``web/zt{w}{h}/<hash>``) when the
        background is an image / a mask is present.  Render flags
        (``overlay_enabled`` / ``rotation`` / ``mask_visible`` / …) carry
        over from the source.
      * image background → stored in the library (deduped); video
        background → bundled verbatim as ``Theme.<ext>`` (videos dedup
        poorly and the in-dir convention already reloads them).
      * mask → stored image-only in the library (no ``config1.dc``); the
        manifest's inline ``elements`` own the layout, so ``ApplyMask`` on
        reload applies the mask image + position WITHOUT clobbering them.
      * ``Theme.png`` — a **snapshot of the live preview composite** (the
        GUI theme-chooser grid tile, just like shipped local themes have).
        Never sent to the device, so baking the full composite is safe.
      * no ``config1.dc`` — ``load()`` reads ``trcc.json`` directly.

    After a successful save the per-device overrides
    (``background_path`` / ``mask_path`` /
    ``user_overlay_elements``) are cleared and ``current_theme`` is
    re-pointed to the new directory.  Without this the next render
    would re-stack the (now-baked-in) overrides on top of the saved
    theme — double-mask, double-bg, doubled overlay text.

    On any failure after ``target.mkdir`` the partially-written
    target is removed and the original DeviceSettings are left
    untouched so the user can retry without losing state.

    Idempotent: a no-op when a theme is already active (a daemon / GUI already
    primed it), so it's safe to dispatch unconditionally at each entry.

    Order (mirrors the GUI connect-restore, minus GUI-only widget restore):
      1. Active theme already loaded → done.
      2. ``RestoreLastTheme`` — the persisted theme + its mask + overlays +

      4. Replay the persisted ``background_path`` video override

    """Encode a clip of *path* into a loose ``Theme.zt`` for *key*'s panel.

    The trimmer's Command.  Both Qt skins had their own QThread around
    :class:`~trcc.services.video_export.VideoExporter` — gui went further
    and hand-rolled the ffmpeg invocation AND the ``.zt`` writer, so the
    container was spelled out twice and had already drifted.  Neither
    copy was reachable from the CLI or the API, which therefore could not
    export a video at all.

    **Distinct from :class:`LoadVideo`, which does not cover this.**
    ``LoadVideo`` stages a whole theme DIRECTORY and applies it; a
    trimmer needs the loose ``.zt`` back so the user can preview it and
    then set it as the device background (``SetBackground``, which
    persists the override that ``SaveTheme`` later bakes in).  Same split
    as ``LoadCloudTheme`` versus ``DownloadCloudTheme``: fetch-and-apply
    is not the same capability as fetch.

    **Returns as soon as the clip is QUEUED.**  ffmpeg runs for minutes
    and the IPC dispatch timeout is 30 s, so waiting here would make the
    Command impossible in daemon mode.  Watch the bus instead: every
    ``VideoExportProgress`` and the terminal ``VideoExportFinished``
    carries the ``token`` this Result hands back.

    ``end_ms=None`` means "to the end of the source", probed on the spot.
    The canvas is the panel's NATIVE size — never the oriented one, since
    the firmware applies the mount rotation itself and ``rotation`` here
    is the user's own turn of the footage on top.
