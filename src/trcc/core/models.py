# small cycle of surfaces that repeats forever -- worth keeping, if keeping
# them cannot grow without bound.  It could: the cache this replaces was
# capped by nothing at all and pre-composed EVERY frame up front, which on a
# 1600x720/897-frame video meant a 4.38s freeze on apply and 3,964 MB
# retained (#264; #256 reports the same shape at 1920x462).  It was deleted
# outright in da4be2e9 rather than bounded, and composing every tick instead
# is what the CPU has been paying since.
#
# Capping by BYTES rather than frame count is the whole point -- the same 144
# frames cost 59 MB at 320x320 and 475 MB at 1600x720, so a frame budget
# would be generous on the panels that were fine and ruinous on the ones that
