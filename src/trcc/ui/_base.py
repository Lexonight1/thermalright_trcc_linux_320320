"""``UserInterface`` — the port every UI face implements, and its registry.

The third registry, beside ``PLATFORMS`` (OS) and ``DEVICES`` (wire).  UI was
always the third adapter family — "each adapter family (OS, Device, UI) should
be one abstract base class = the interface, with factory children that share
the same method NAMES but supply different INTERNALS" — and it is the one that
never got the treatment.  CLI, API, GUI, qtgui and the daemon were five
hand-written bring-up sequences with five different signatures.

**Why a bus and not a convention.**  ``METHOD_UI.md`` already declared the
launch contract (``run(platform) -> int``), but a contract that lives only in
prose is a contract nothing checks.  The cost is on record: ``App.start_session``
exists *because* the bring-up was copy-pasted into ``run_daemon`` / ``run_gui``
/ ``run_qtgui``, one copy drifted, and a reporter running ``trccd.service``
watched a connected device stay permanently blank until the missing
``metrics_loop.start()`` was added to that copy alone (#148).  This module makes
the sequence structural: there is one ``start()``, and a UI supplies only what
genuinely differs.

Register by naming the key in the class line, exactly as a wire adapter does::

    class GuiUI(UserInterface, name="gui"): ...

``name=None`` means "intermediate base, don't register".

**Placement is load-bearing, and it is gated.**  Concrete UI classes live in
``ui/_uis.py``, NOT inside ``ui/gui/`` or ``ui/qtgui/``.  Importing *any*
submodule of those packages runs their ``__init__``, which imports the whole
window: measured, ``import trcc.ui.gui.assets`` costs **249 ms and pulls 17
PySide6 modules**.  Because this registry populates by eager side-effect import
— the same way ``DEVICES`` does — a class placed there would put PySide6 and
FastAPI on the critical path of every ``trcc`` invocation, ~700 ms against a
~350 ms baseline.  Keeping the classes light instead costs **~1 ms and loads
zero heavy modules**, which is what lets this use the ONE registry idiom rather
than inventing a lazy second one.  ``tests/test_ui_bus.py`` gates it.
