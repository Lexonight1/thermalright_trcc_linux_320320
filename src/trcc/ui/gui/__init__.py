"""GUI composition root for next/ — wires Qt adapter.

Single entry point for the graphical interface.  Builds the windowed
``QApplication`` (which Qt requires before any QWidget), constructs an
``App`` via ``trcc._boot.trcc()``, then hands the app handle
to ``MainWindow``.  ``discover`` runs in a background ``BootstrapWorker``
so the splash shows immediate feedback.

Composition root — this is the ONE place that imports concrete adapters
(``Platform``, ``QtRenderer``, ``SingleInstance``).  Every other file under
``ui/gui/`` holds an ``App`` handle and dispatches Commands.

This UI does NOT host an IPC server.  It used to construct one, but only
``IPCServer.start()`` (bind + listen) was ever called and nothing served it,
so it squatted on the daemon's socket answering nothing — ``daemon_running()``
reported a daemon that did not exist, ``trcc daemon`` refused to start while
the GUI was open, and a live ``trccd`` was orphaned by the unconditional
unlink.  The daemon is the only process that may own that socket; a UI
reaches it as a client, and only when ``TRCC_DAEMON=1``.

    """Run the GUI composition from an injected ``platform``.  Returns exit code.

    A thin alias over the UI bus (``ui/_base.py``): the launch sequence —
    single-instance guard, compose, bring up, run, close — is
    ``UserInterface.start`` and is shared with every other face.  What stays
    the GUI's own is ``GuiUI``: its lock, its Qt-first composition, its splash
    bootstrap and its window.

    Two things stay HERE rather than on the face, because they are process
    concerns rather than UI behaviour:

    * ``platform.configure_stdout()`` — must precede the single-instance check
      and everything that writes output (a Windows console defaults to cp1252
      and crashes on non-ASCII).  It takes the INJECTED platform, which is what
      the dev mock wants.
    * ``force_exit`` — ``os._exit`` must run AFTER the bus's ``finally`` has
      closed the App, so it cannot live inside ``GuiUI.run``.  Qt's
      metrics/sensor/render threads occasionally outlive ``qapp.exec()`` when
      native libraries (pynvml, psutil, pyusb) hold the GIL on shutdown;
      cleanup has already happened by here, so forcing the reap is safe.  The
      dev mock passes ``force_exit=False`` and returns normally.
