"""LCDHandler — one per LCD device, wired to next/ Commands.

Self-contained handler for a single LCD device.  Holds:

* ``_device_key`` — vid:pid; ``app.devices[key]`` is the live Device
* ``_app: App`` — universal command/event hub
* ``_pm.state: DeviceState`` — cached canvas / mask / theme info,
  refreshed on connect / orientation / theme-load events
* ``_w`` — shared GUI widgets (preview, theme tabs, cuts, etc.)

Every device mutation goes through ``self._app.dispatch(Command(...))``.
Animation state (playing, interval, current frame) comes from
``VideoStatus`` / ``TickDisplay`` on the same bus — handler delegates
rather than caches, and never reaches into ``app.media`` (which does not
exist on the ``AppProxy`` a daemon-mode UI holds, #249).

        for bytes and remember that answer.

        ``width`` is what makes that unambiguous — ``BuildPreview`` sets it
