    GUI already holds the device — so this costs an attached device nothing.

    Applied per-ROUTE, never to the whole router.  Only 9 of the 63
    device-scoped routes actually need a device: the rest are settings
    mutations, and ``SetBrightness`` / ``SetOrientation`` / ``StopVideo`` /
    ``RestoreDeviceState`` were each verified to answer ``ok=True`` with
