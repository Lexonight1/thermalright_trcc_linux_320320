"""``WS /events`` — the bus, pushed to REST clients.

The API could dispatch and it could read, but it could not **observe**.
Everything a UI learns without asking — a device attached, a theme loaded,
sensors ticked, a video export finishing — reached the two Qt skins through
``BusBridge`` and the CLI through ``AppProxy.events``, and reached a REST
client not at all.  A browser dashboard had to poll, which is both wasteful
and unable to see anything transient: an export publishes its progress once
and never repeats it.

**One wire format, not two.**  The envelopes here are produced by
``ipc.encode_event`` — the same serializer the daemon's Unix socket uses — so
a WebSocket client and a socket client see byte-identical JSON, and a new
Event is zero-touch for both.  Writing a second encoder here would have been
the "one fact expressed twice" trap with a network in the middle.

**Why a plain ``queue.Queue`` and not ``asyncio.Queue``.**  ``EventBus.publish``
is synchronous and arrives from arbitrary threads — the sensor poller, a
device worker, the video-export runner, the IPC fan-out.  ``asyncio.Queue`` is
not thread-safe and its ``put_nowait`` from a foreign thread is a race.  The
handler therefore touches nothing but a thread-safe queue, and the coroutine
drains it.
