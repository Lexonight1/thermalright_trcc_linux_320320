"""The concrete UI faces — deliberately LIGHT.

Importing this module is what populates :data:`~trcc.ui._base.UIS`, the same
way importing ``adapters.device`` populates ``DEVICES``.  That only stays
affordable because **every heavy import in this file lives inside a method
body**: measured 2026-09-08, ``import trcc.daemon`` costs 153 ms,
``trcc.ipc`` 198 ms and ``trcc.ui.gui`` 247 ms, so hoisting any of them to
module scope would put that on the critical path of every ``trcc`` invocation.
As written, the marginal cost of the bus in the context that actually runs it —
a CLI process that has already imported ``ui.cli.main`` — is **0.13 ms**, and
it pulls exactly one new module.

Two rules follow, and ``tests/test_ui_bus.py`` gates both:

* heavy imports stay in method bodies;
* these classes do NOT live under ``ui/gui/`` or ``ui/qtgui/``, because
  importing *any* submodule of those packages runs their ``__init__`` --
  ``import trcc.ui.gui.assets`` costs 249 ms and loads 17 PySide6 modules.

The CLI is absent on purpose.  It is the **router**, not a leaf face: it
composes lazily per subcommand (``_ctx.get_app()``), so putting it through
``compose() -> run(app)`` would build an App it discards — and under
``TRCC_DAEMON=1`` would spawn a daemon that a ``trcc --help`` never needed.
