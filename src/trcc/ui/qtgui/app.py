"""GUI entry — QApplication + MainWindow shell.

MainWindow is a horizontal split: an ``ActivitySidebar`` on the left and
a ``QStackedWidget`` on the right that swaps the active panel.  Every
panel subclasses :class:`BasePanel` so they share the same ``app`` /
``bus`` plumbing.

Adding a panel: register the widget on the stacked container with the
same key the sidebar emits, and add an entry to ``sidebar._ENTRIES``.
