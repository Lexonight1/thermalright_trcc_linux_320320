"""EventBus → Qt signals bridge — one bridge, every Qt skin.

``EventBus`` calls are synchronous and arrive from arbitrary threads (the
sensor poller, a device worker, the daemon IPC server).  Qt widgets must
update on the main thread.  This bridge subscribes once per event type and
re-emits each event as a Qt signal; widgets connect with
``Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection`` to marshal onto the main thread.

**One bridge for both skins.**  ``ui/gui`` and ``ui/qtgui`` each carried a
copy, and they had drifted: the qtgui copy was a strict *subset* — no
``video_*``, no ``screencast_*``, no ``system_*`` — so that skin could not
learn a video had started or that the machine was suspending, whatever its
widgets did.  A shared bridge means a new event is one row here and both
skins can see it.  Lives beside ``ui/qt_tray.py`` and ``ui/qapp.py``, the
established home for Qt code both skins share.
