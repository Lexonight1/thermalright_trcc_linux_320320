"""AppProxy — client-side drop-in for ``App`` that talks to the daemon.

UIs hold a typed ``App`` and never distinguish; in daemon mode the
``_boot.trcc()`` factory hands them an ``AppProxy`` instead.  Only
``dispatch(cmd) -> Result`` is real — every call serializes the Command,
sends it over the Unix socket, and reconstructs the typed Result.

``events`` is the ONE other attribute that is real, and it has to be: both
Qt skins build a ``BusBridge(app.events)`` at construction, so without it a
GUI cannot run as a daemon client at all — which is what kept
``TRCC_DAEMON=1`` off by default and the bus optional.  The proxy answers it
with a LOCAL ``EventBus`` fed by the daemon's stream, so every existing
subscriber works unchanged and nothing in ``ui/`` needs to know.

Other ``App`` attributes (``platform`` / ``settings`` / ``devices`` /
``display``) are not exposed by the proxy.  UIs that need state should
dispatch a Command (``DiscoverDevices`` / ``GetPlatformInfo`` /
``ReadSensors``) — that's the API contract daemon mode honors.
