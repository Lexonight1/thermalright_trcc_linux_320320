"""Structured logging setup — rotating file + stderr.

Replaces legacy ``adapters/infra/diagnostics.py``'s 200-line logging
block with a focused configurator that:

* writes to ``Paths.log_file()`` with rotation at 1 MB × 5 backups so
  long-lived daemons don't fill the disk;
* also writes a sibling ``<stem>.latest.log`` truncated fresh on every
  process start, so "what did THIS launch do" is always the whole file
  with no rotation/offset math — the rotating log keeps cross-run
  history, the latest log isolates the current run;
* mirrors WARNING+ to stderr so terminal users see issues without
  digging into the log file;
* uses a single timestamped format every TRCC logger inherits.

Idempotent — calling ``configure_logging`` twice is safe (we tag our
handlers so the second call clears and re-installs them rather than
stacking duplicates).

    """A rotating handler that renders each record ONCE.

    ``logging`` renders the same record four times in this app, and three of
    those are waste.  CPython's ``RotatingFileHandler.shouldRollover`` calls
    ``self.format(record)`` solely to take ``len()`` of the result and then
    discards it -- and that happens once per rotating handler, of which two are
    attached (the rolling history and the per-run ``latest``).  Each render
    re-runs ``strftime`` as well.  Counted, not inferred: four
    ``Formatter.format`` and four ``Formatter.formatTime`` calls per record.

    That was affordable when it was assumed to be a disk question.  Measured on
    the real device, logging is 82-90%% of the CPU regression since v9.9.2, so
    rendering the same string four times is not free.

    The rendered text is a function of (record, formatter) alone, so it is
    cached on the record and keyed by the formatter's IDENTITY -- a handler
    carrying a different formatter still renders its own text rather than
    inheriting someone else's.  Nothing about WHAT gets logged changes; only
    how many times it is turned into a string.

    Deliberately carries no log line: ``logging`` calls this while formatting a
    record, so emitting one here would recurse forever.  The coverage ratchet
    exempts it for that reason, qualified by this base class rather than by the
    method name.

    ``tail_log`` selects by recency, which is the wrong axis for a bug
    report.  Every function in this project logs, so one rendered frame
    costs ~43 DEBUG lines and one overlay click ~125 — meaning a 1000-line
    tail remembers roughly twenty frames.  A reporter who hits a problem and
    then keeps using the app for another minute sends us a file where what
    they DID has already scrolled out, and we spend a round trip asking them
    to do it again.

    So this selects by significance instead: the user-action lines
    (INFO), the silent-skip warnings and the failures, however far back they
    are.  Tracebacks are kept with the record they belong to — an
    ``ERROR`` whose stack was dropped is the half of the answer that
    matters least.

    Streams the file with a bounded ``deque`` rather than reading it whole,
    so it stays flat in memory on a rotated 10 MB ``latest`` log.  Same
    shape as ``_scrape_handshake_lines``, which solved this for one line
    type after the tail window ate it.

    The default is deliberately HALF the tail's budget, not a tenth.  The
    ratio of DEBUG to significant lines swings enormously with what the app
    is doing — measured on two real logs, one was 980 DEBUG / 20 INFO per
    thousand and the other 562 / 438.  A small window is a clear win against
    the first and a REGRESSION against the second, handing the reporter
    fewer significant lines than the plain tail already contained.  500
    keeps this section at least comparable to the tail's significant content
