"""Structured logging setup — rotating file + stderr.

Replaces legacy ``adapters/infra/diagnostics.py``'s 200-line logging
block with a focused configurator that:

* writes to ``Paths.log_file()`` with rotation at 1 MB × 5 backups so
  long-lived daemons don't fill the disk;
* also writes a sibling ``<stem>.latest.log`` truncated fresh on every
  process start, so "what did THIS launch do" is always the whole file
  with no rotation/offset math — the rotating log keeps cross-run
  history, the latest log isolates the current run;
* mirrors WARNING+ to stderr so terminal users see issues without
  digging into the log file;
* uses a single timestamped format every TRCC logger inherits.

Idempotent — calling ``configure_logging`` twice is safe (we tag our
handlers so the second call clears and re-installs them rather than
stacking duplicates).

    """A rotating handler that renders each record ONCE.

    ``logging`` renders the same record four times in this app, and three of
    those are waste.  CPython's ``RotatingFileHandler.shouldRollover`` calls
    ``self.format(record)`` solely to take ``len()`` of the result and then
    discards it -- and that happens once per rotating handler, of which two are
    attached (the rolling history and the per-run ``latest``).  Each render
    re-runs ``strftime`` as well.  Counted, not inferred: four
    ``Formatter.format`` and four ``Formatter.formatTime`` calls per record.

    That was affordable when it was assumed to be a disk question.  Measured on
    the real device, logging is 82-90%% of the CPU regression since v9.9.2, so
    rendering the same string four times is not free.

    The rendered text is a function of (record, formatter) alone, so it is
    cached on the record and keyed by the formatter's IDENTITY -- a handler
    carrying a different formatter still renders its own text rather than
    inheriting someone else's.  Nothing about WHAT gets logged changes; only
    how many times it is turned into a string.

    Deliberately carries no log line: ``logging`` calls this while formatting a
    record, so emitting one here would recurse forever.  The coverage ratchet
    exempts it for that reason, qualified by this base class rather than by the
    method name.

class _SharedRotatingFileHandler(RenderOnceRotatingFileHandler, ABC):
    """A rotating handler several PROCESSES may write to at once.

    The daemon flip makes concurrent writers permanent — the daemon owns USB
    and rendering while a CLI or GUI client dispatches into it, and both log to
    ``~/.trcc/trcc.log``.  ``RotatingFileHandler`` cannot survive that, because
    every writer rotates independently:

    * **It crashes.**  Two processes shift the chain at once, so one renames a
      file the other already moved.  ``FileNotFoundError`` inside ``emit``,
      reproduced on every multi-writer run (3–18 per run at 2–4 writers).
    * **It loses records.**  At a FIXED total volume, measured against a
      single-writer control: 1 writer keeps 47.8%, 2 keep 47.7%, **3 keep
      30.2%**.  Two writers cost nothing; the chain over-advances from three.
    * **It orphans writers.**  After a peer rotates, our stream still points at
      the renamed inode, so we keep appending to a file nothing reads.

    Two changes fix all three, and they share one syscall:

    1. ``emit`` runs under an advisory lock on a sidecar file, so rotation is
       serialised.  The lock is on a SIDECAR, not the log stream, because
       ``doRollover`` closes that stream — there would be no fd left to unlock.
    2. :meth:`shouldRollover` asks ``os.stat`` for the SHARED file rather than
       ``self.stream.tell()`` for our private position.  One stat answers both
       questions: the size every writer sees, and — via ``st_ino`` — whether
       the file we hold is still the file at ``baseFilename``.

    Measured on these classes, at a FIXED total volume, percentage of records
    surviving anywhere in the chain:

        writers      1       2       3       4     rollover crashes
        before    47.8%   47.7%   30.2%   30.2%          3-18
        after     47.8%   47.8%   47.7%   47.7%             0

    Three writers now retain exactly what one does — concurrency costs nothing
    — and the crash is gone.  (47.8% is not a defect: it is what a 6 MB chain
    does to 12 MB of records, single writer included.)

    The price is one ``stat`` replacing one ``tell()``, plus the lock:
    126,675 -> 137,900 instructions per record, **+8.9%** (P-cores pinned —
    ``cpu_atom`` reports pure extrapolation on a hybrid CPU — three replicates
    within 0.6%).  A leaner inline version measured +6.7%; the 2.2 points buy
    the two hooks below being the ONLY place each OS's primitive is named.
    Paying even that per FRAME would not be worth it, which is exactly why
    per-frame lines are off unless ``-vvv``.

    **Nothing under the lock may log.**  ``flock`` keeps no recursion count, so
    a log line inside ``emit`` / ``shouldRollover`` / ``doRollover`` re-enters
    ``emit``, whose ``finally`` drops the lock while a rotation is half-done.
    The coverage ratchet exempts exactly those methods for that reason.

    #: May this handler hold the log file open BETWEEN records?
    #:
    #: On POSIX, yes — renaming a file someone else has open is an inode swap
    #: and simply works, which is what makes the lock sufficient there.
    #:
    #: On Windows it is not.  ``os.rename`` needs exclusive access to the
    #: source, and CPython's ``open(path, "a")`` does not request
    #: ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``, so a PEER's open handle fails the rename with
    #: **WinError 32** — and serialising rotation does nothing about it,
    #: because the peer is not the process rotating.  The consequence is not a
    #: lost rotation but a dead log: ``RotatingFileHandler.emit`` catches the
    #: error, the file stays over ``maxBytes``, and every record afterwards
    #: takes the same path and is dropped.

    costs ~43 DEBUG lines and one overlay click ~125 — meaning a 1000-line
    tail remembers roughly twenty frames.  A reporter who hits a problem and
    then keeps using the app for another minute sends us a file where what
    they DID has already scrolled out, and we spend a round trip asking them
    to do it again.

    So this selects by significance instead: the user-action lines
    (INFO), the silent-skip warnings and the failures, however far back they

    ``ERROR`` whose stack was dropped is the half of the answer that

    which solved this for one line type after the tail window ate it.

    The default is deliberately HALF the tail's budget, not a tenth.  The
    ratio of DEBUG to significant lines swings enormously with what the app
    is doing — measured on two real logs, one was 980 DEBUG / 20 INFO per
    thousand and the other 562 / 438.  A small window is a clear win against
    the first and a REGRESSION against the second, handing the reporter
    fewer significant lines than the plain tail already contained.  500

    Startup crashes are the ones we can least afford to lose: an import that

    anything knows where the log file is, because that answer lives behind
    ``adapters.system`` — 48 modules and pyusb / psutil / pynvml.

    ``__main__.py`` used to solve this by installing its OWN
    ``RotatingFileHandler`` on a hardcoded path before importing anything.  It
    is the same fact written twice, and both copies had drifted:

    * the path was ``~/.trcc/trcc.log`` on every OS, while the report reads
      ``%APPDATA%\\trcc`` on Windows and ``~/Library/.../Logs`` on macOS — and
      BOTH frozen builds run this file, so every shipped Windows and macOS
      binary wrote its startup records where nothing would ever read them;
    * the format used ``'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`` and ``[LEVEL]``, so
      ``_log_level_of`` read the time-of-day as the level and classified every
      early record as a CONTINUATION line.  ``tail_log_actions`` returned **0
      lines** for a startup ``CRITICAL`` — the one record the shim existed to
      produce;
    * ``backupCount=3`` against ``configure_logging``'s 5 left ``.4`` and
      ``.5`` frozen forever once the shim owned a rotation, stranding a third
      of the history.

    Buffering instead of writing fixes all three at once, because the records
    are only ever rendered by the REAL handlers.  The cost is that a hard crash
    — a segfault, not an exception — loses the buffer where a file would have
    kept it.  On macOS and Windows that file was unreadable by the report
