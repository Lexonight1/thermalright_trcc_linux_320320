# This BUFFERS; it does not open a file.  Where the log lives is a question
# only the platform layer can answer, and that layer is 48 modules including
# pyusb, psutil and pynvml — the very imports whose failure this exists to
# record.  So the records are held until ``configure_logging`` knows the real
# destination, and replayed through the real handlers.
#
# It used to install its own RotatingFileHandler on a hardcoded path, which is
# the same fact written twice.  Both copies had drifted: the path was
# ``~/.trcc/trcc.log`` on every OS while the report reads ``%APPDATA%\trcc``
# on Windows and ``~/Library/.../Logs`` on macOS — and BOTH frozen builds are
# entry-pointed at THIS file, so every shipped Windows and macOS binary wrote
# its startup records where nothing would read them.  The format drifted too:
# ``tail_log_actions`` returned zero lines for a startup CRITICAL, because a
# space-separated date and a bracketed level made every early record parse as a
# continuation.  See ``start_early_logging``.
