"""trcc daemon — background process that owns USB + serves UIs.

One process per user.  Holds the singleton ``App`` and serves Commands
over a Unix-domain socket via ``IPCServer``.  CLI clients dispatched
through ``AppProxy`` see the same Command API; the proxy round-trips
each call to the daemon.

Lifecycle::

    1. Bail out fast if another daemon already owns the socket.
    2. Build the App through ``_boot``.
    3. Bind IPCServer to the App and start the accept loop.
    4. Install SIGTERM / SIGINT handlers that flip the server's stop flag.
    5. Block in ``serve_forever`` until the loop exits.

Opt-in today (``TRCC_DAEMON=1``).  No Qt event loop — next/'s App
is framework-blind, so the daemon is a plain Python process.

    ``DaemonUI.run`` -- the IPC server and its signal handlers.
