# Development Status

TRCC Linux is **feature-complete** — all 45 features from the Windows TRCC 2.0.3 have been ported, with full CLI/GUI/API parity via hexagonal architecture.

**Current version:** 3.0.1
**Branch:** `stable`
**Tests:** 2148 across 31 files
**PyPI:** [trcc-linux](https://pypi.org/project/trcc-linux/)

## What's Stable

All features are tested and working on the `stable` branch:

- **4 protocol backends** — SCSI, HID, LED, Bulk (raw USB)
- **Full GUI** — local/cloud/mask themes, overlays, video playback, carousel, image cropper, video trimmer
- **System info overlays** — 77+ sensors (CPU, GPU, RAM, disk, network, fans)
- **LED RGB control** — 7 effect modes (Static, Breathing, Rainbow, Cycle, Wave, Flash, Music), sensor-linked colors
- **HR10 support** — 7-segment display renderer, NVMe temperature daemon, color wheel
- **Per-device config** — each LCD remembers its theme, brightness, rotation, overlay, and carousel settings
- **Autostart** — launches minimized to system tray on login, sends last-used theme
- **CLI** — 36 Typer commands with full service parity (theme, LED, display, overlay, screencast, video, diagnostics)
- **REST API** — optional FastAPI adapter for headless/remote control (`trcc serve`)
- **Services layer** — 8 pure-Python service classes shared by GUI, CLI, and API
- **Cross-distro compatibility** — tested on Fedora, Debian/Ubuntu, Arch, openSUSE, Void, Alpine, Gentoo, NixOS, SteamOS, Bazzite
- **96% test coverage** — 2148 tests across 31 test files
