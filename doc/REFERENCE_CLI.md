TRCC — Thermalright LCD/LED cooler control (clean-slate build).

Commands that act on a device take its **`KEY`** — the USB `VID:PID` shown by `trcc detect`, e.g. `0402:3922` — as the first argument.

```bash
trcc [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
```

## Global options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--verbose`, `-v` `VERBOSE` | Terminal log verbosity: -v INFO (major milestones), -vv DEBUG (granular state and variable values), -vvv TRACE (deep internals: raw payloads and per-frame detail). Without it the terminal stays quiet — warnings and errors only. The log file always keeps DEBUG regardless, so `trcc report` carries the evidence even when nobody passed a flag. |
| `--version`, `-V` | Print the installed TRCC version and exit. |

## Commands

### `trcc api`

Launch the REST API (FastAPI + uvicorn). Three operating modes: * `trcc api` — loopback only (127.0.0.1), no auth. Dev default. * `trcc api --host 0.0.0.0 --token <secret>` — public bind, token required on every request. Use a long random secret. * `trcc api --host 0.0.0.0 --token <secret> --pair` — same as above plus the pairing endpoint; a 6-char code is shown so a remote app can fetch the token without out-of-band copy/paste. Refusal: `--host` other than `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` without `--token` exits 2 — would otherwise expose every endpoint to LAN.

```bash
trcc api [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--host`, `-H` `HOST` | Bind address |
| `--port`, `-p` `PORT` | Bind port |
| `--token`, `-t` `TOKEN` | Persistent API token. When set, every request must carry `X-API-Token: <token>`. When omitted with --host 127.0.0.1, the API is unauth'd (loopback dev mode). Omitting it with any other --host is REJECTED — refusing to bind a public interface without auth. Use --token random:<n> to generate. |
| `--pair` | Show a one-time 6-char pairing code in the terminal. Remote devices POST it to /pair to exchange for the API token. Requires --token. |

### `trcc daemon`

Run the background daemon that owns USB + serves CLI/API clients. One process per user. Binds a Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/trcc.sock` and serves Commands until SIGTERM / SIGINT or a remote `trcc kill`. Sets `TRCC_DAEMON=1` to route clients through this daemon.

```bash
trcc daemon
```

### `trcc daemon-status`

Report whether the background daemon socket is reachable. Replaces the previous top-level `status` command, which conflated daemon reachability with app state. Use `trcc status` for the unified app + device snapshot.

```bash
trcc daemon-status
```

### `trcc detect`

Alias for `trcc device list` — list attached devices.

```bash
trcc detect
```

### `trcc doctor`

Alias for `trcc system doctor` — health checks.

```bash
trcc doctor
```

### `trcc ensure-daemon`

Start the background daemon if it is not already running. *Is the daemon up? No — create it. Yes — nothing to do.* Idempotent, so a script can run it unconditionally before dispatching rather than probing first and racing between the probe and the spawn. Worth doing before a batch of commands: the daemon owns USB, the sensor poll and the render loop, so every client that talks to it does that work zero times instead of once each.

```bash
trcc ensure-daemon [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--timeout` `TIMEOUT` | Seconds to wait for a spawned daemon. |

### `trcc gui`

Launch the legacy Windows-style GUI (port in progress). Today's shell hosts the device sidebar + a diagnostic content area — enough to prove the legacy-on-next/-bus pattern end to end on real hardware. Real feature panels (LCD handler, theme settings, mask, video, LED) land in subsequent passes. `--resume` starts hidden in the tray (XDG autostart-on-login); bare `trcc gui` shows the window. `--decorated` asks the window manager for a normal frame. The default shell is frameless and drags by its top strip, which some window managers will not move at all — leaving the window pinned where it opened with no way to shift it (#231). The capability already existed and two guides already documented the flag; only the flag itself was missing (#247).

```bash
trcc gui [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--resume`, `--tray`, `--minimized` | Start hidden in the system tray instead of showing the window — used by XDG autostart on login. The last-used theme is restored automatically. |
| `--decorated` | Draw the window with your desktop's normal title bar and borders instead of the frameless Windows-style shell. Use it if the window will not move or your window manager does not decorate frameless windows. |

### `trcc kill`

Ask the running daemon to shut down, return when its socket is gone.

```bash
trcc kill
```

### `trcc qtgui`

Launch the Qt-native GUI (clean-slate, layout-driven). This is the rebuild's GUI — built up over G1–G5 and used during development. See `gui` for the legacy Windows-style port. `--resume` starts hidden in the tray, the same as `gui`. Without it qtgui could not be autostarted sanely: it would pop a window on every login where the gui skin comes up quietly.

```bash
trcc qtgui [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--resume`, `--tray`, `--minimized` | Start hidden in the system tray instead of showing the window — used by autostart on login. |

### `trcc quickstart`

Guided first-session flow for new users. Runs the doctor, scans for devices, and walks you through what to do next. Pass `--yes` to also test-connect to the first device found. Safe to re-run any time.

```bash
trcc quickstart [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--yes`, `-y` | If a device is found, also connect + push a green test frame. Default: stop after scan so you can inspect what's there. |

### `trcc report`

Alias for `trcc system debug-report` — full diagnostic dump.

```bash
trcc report [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--output`, `-o` `OUTPUT` | Write the report to this path instead of stdout. |
| `--log-lines` `LOG_LINES` | How many trailing log lines to include. |

### `trcc sensors`

Alias for `trcc system sensors` — print sensor readings.

```bash
trcc sensors
```

### `trcc serve`

Alias for `trcc api` — launches the REST API + uvicorn. The `serve` name matches legacy CLI ergonomics; `api` still works for backwards-compat with existing scripts.

```bash
trcc serve [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--host`, `-H` `HOST` | Bind address |
| `--port`, `-p` `PORT` | Bind port |
| `--token`, `-t` `TOKEN` | Same semantics as `trcc api --token` — see `trcc api --help`. |
| `--pair` | Same semantics as `trcc api --pair` — see `trcc api --help`. |

### `trcc setup`

Alias for `trcc system setup` — OS-specific setup (udev rules on Linux, WinUSB guide on Windows). New users reach for the short form. (#194)

```bash
trcc setup [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--yes`, `-y` | Non-interactive (assume yes to prompts) |

### `trcc shell`

Open an interactive prompt sharing one App across commands. Each line is parsed as if it were a fresh `trcc` invocation, but the App is built once and reused — no per-command handshake. In daemon mode the App is an AppProxy that round-trips each line to the running daemon. Ctrl-D or `exit` quits.

```bash
trcc shell
```

### `trcc status`

Show unified app + LCD + LED state. Composes `ControlCenterSnapshot` (app prefs) with per-device `LcdSnapshot` / `LedSnapshot` — one round-trip for "what state is everything in right now?". Pass `--json` for scripts. Use `trcc daemon-status` for daemon reachability checks.

```bash
trcc status [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Emit JSON instead of human text. |

### `trcc version`

Print the installed TRCC version.

```bash
trcc version
```

## `trcc config`

App-global preferences: temp unit, language, GPU, refresh interval.

### `trcc config date-format`

Set the global LCD overlay date format.

```bash
trcc config date-format FMT
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `FMT` | LCD date format, e.g. 'yyyy/MM/dd', 'dd.MM.yyyy', 'MM/dd/yyyy' |

### `trcc config disk`

Pick which drive supplies disk temperature. Empty string = hottest.

```bash
trcc config disk [KEY]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Disk sensor key (from 'trcc system list-disk-sensors') or '' to follow the hottest drive *(optional)* |

### `trcc config gpu`

Pick the primary GPU for sensor overlays. Empty string = auto.

```bash
trcc config gpu [KEY]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | GPU sensor key (e.g. 'nvidia:0') or '' to clear *(optional)* |

### `trcc config language`

Set the UI language.

```bash
trcc config language LANG
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `LANG` | ISO 639-1 code, e.g. 'en', 'zh', 'fr' |

### `trcc config refresh-interval`

Set the global metrics-refresh / render-and-send tick interval.

```bash
trcc config refresh-interval SECONDS
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `SECONDS` | Seconds between metric refreshes (1 to 100) |

### `trcc config temp-unit`

Set the global temperature unit (propagates to every device).

```bash
trcc config temp-unit UNIT
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `UNIT` | Either 'C' or 'F' |

### `trcc config time-format`

Set the global LCD overlay clock format.

```bash
trcc config time-format FMT
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `FMT` | LCD clock format: '12h' or '24h' |

## `trcc device`

Discover and connect to TRCC devices.

### `trcc device connect`

Open USB transport and perform the wire-protocol handshake.

```bash
trcc device connect KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

### `trcc device disconnect`

Close the transport and drop the device.

```bash
trcc device disconnect KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | -- |

### `trcc device issues`

Show devices that failed to connect, and why. A connect can fail before anything is watching the bus, so the failure is pulled with a query rather than only published — the same one the GUIs and `GET /devices/issues` use.

```bash
trcc device issues
```

### `trcc device list`

List devices currently attached to the host.

```bash
trcc device list
```

### `trcc device reset`

Power-cycle a device: disconnect, reconnect, restore its display. Use this when the LCD seems stuck. The connection is torn down and rebuilt and the persisted theme is put back, so the panel ends up showing what it showed before — no second `connect` needed. Not the same as blanking the panel to a known colour; that is `trcc display reset`, which leaves the device connected.

```bash
trcc device reset KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | -- |

### `trcc device state`

Show what a device IS — identity, connection, handshake geometry. `native_resolution` is what the product registry claims; `resolution` is what the panel answered at handshake. When they differ, the handshake wins and the difference is usually the thing worth reporting.

```bash
trcc device state KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

## `trcc display`

Configure device display (theme / orientation / brightness).

### `trcc display apply-mask`

Override the active theme's mask with a user-supplied image.

```bash
trcc display apply-mask KEY PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `PATH` | Image file path (png/jpg/jpeg/bmp/webp) |

### `trcc display background`

Set a file as the device's persistent background override. Distinct from `background-mode`, which picks WHAT fills the panel (theme / colour / transparent). This supplies the file itself, and it survives a theme change until cleared.

```bash
trcc display background KEY PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `PATH` | Image or video file to use as the background |

### `trcc display background-mode`

Pick what fills the LCD behind overlays.

```bash
trcc display background-mode KEY MODE
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `MODE` | 'theme' / 'color' / 'transparent' |

### `trcc display boot-anim`

Upload a multi-frame compressed boot animation to a SCSI LCD's flash. The animation plays from device flash on every boot until overwritten. Only SCSI panels with 240×240 / 240×320 / 320×240 / 320×320 resolution support boot animations. Frame files are picked up in alphabetical order from *frames_dir* — PNG / JPG / JPEG / BMP / WebP. Each frame uses the same dwell time via --delay (per-frame delays via the API only).

```bash
trcc display boot-anim [OPTIONS] KEY FRAMES_DIR
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 (SCSI only) |
| `FRAMES_DIR` | Directory of image frames (sorted alphabetically; 1–248 frames) |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--delay`, `-d` `DELAY_DS` | Dwell time per frame in deciseconds (10 = 1.0 s, max 25 = 2.5 s) |

### `trcc display color`

Display a single solid color on the LCD. Smallest path that exercises the full wire chain (handshake-derived profile + DisplayService encoder + Device.send). Useful diagnostic for confirming a device class works end-to-end on real hardware.

```bash
trcc display color KEY HEX_COLOR
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `HEX_COLOR` | Hex color (e.g. ff0000 for red) |

### `trcc display configure-slideshow`

Set the slideshow theme list + interval.

```bash
trcc display configure-slideshow [OPTIONS] KEY THEMES
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `THEMES` | Theme names (directories under user_content_dir) — order matters |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--interval`, `-i` `INTERVAL` | Seconds between theme swaps (default 60). |

### `trcc display keepalive`

Periodically resend the device's last frame. Workaround for Bulk/LY firmware that drops the displayed image when the internal buffer ages out. Render at least once before starting the loop so there's a cached frame to resend. `count=0` (default) runs open-ended and exits cleanly on Ctrl-C — the Command itself owns the loop + signal handling so the CLI doesn't need a user-space `while` wrapper.

```bash
trcc display keepalive [OPTIONS] KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--interval`, `-i` `INTERVAL` | Seconds between resends. Bulk/LY firmware reverts to the built-in logo after ~2-3 s without a frame; default 0.150 s keeps the screen pinned. |
| `--count`, `-c` `COUNT` | Number of resends; 0 means loop forever (until Ctrl-C). |
| `--metric-interval` `METRIC_INTERVAL` | Seconds between overlay re-renders (live sensor refresh). 0 disables — last frame's metrics stay frozen on screen. |

### `trcc display list-masks`

List mask images for the device's resolution. By default, scans both the cloud-downloaded mask dir (`data/web/zt{W}{H}`) and the user-created mask dir (`user_content_dir/data/web/zt{W}{H}`).

```bash
trcc display list-masks [OPTIONS] [KEY]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key (e.g. 0402:3922) — its resolution scopes the scan. Required unless --dir is given. *(optional)* |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--dir`, `-d` `DIRECTORY` | Override: scan an explicit directory instead of the device's mask dirs |

### `trcc display load-image`

Show a single image on the LCD. Stages the image as a one-file theme so the existing render pipeline handles fit + brightness + rotation. Re-runnable: subsequent loads of the same image are cheap (no re-copy).

```bash
trcc display load-image KEY PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `PATH` | Image file (PNG / JPG / JPEG / BMP / WEBP) |

### `trcc display load-theme`

Load a theme: parse, persist, render+send if device is connected.

```bash
trcc display load-theme KEY PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `PATH` | Theme directory |

### `trcc display load-video`

Play a video on the LCD as a single-video theme. Transcodes the source to a `Theme.zt` matching the device's native resolution (.zt inputs are copied as-is), stages a one-file theme, then dispatches LoadTheme. Device must be attached so we know the target resolution.

```bash
trcc display load-video [OPTIONS] KEY PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `PATH` | Video file (MP4 / MOV / WEBM / MKV / AVI / ZT) |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--start`, `-s` `START_MS` | Clip start in milliseconds (default: 0). |
| `--end`, `-e` `END_MS` | Clip end in milliseconds (default: probe duration, fallback 10s). |
| `--rotation`, `-r` `ROTATION` | Rotation in degrees: 0 / 90 / 180 / 270. |

### `trcc display loop-video`

Toggle whether video wraps at the end or sticks at the last frame.

```bash
trcc display loop-video KEY STATE
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key |
| `STATE` | 'on' (loop) or 'off' (single-pass) |

### `trcc display mask-position`

Position the mask overlay within the canvas.

```bash
trcc display mask-position KEY X Y
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `X` | X offset in pixels (≥ 0) |
| `Y` | Y offset in pixels (≥ 0) |

### `trcc display mask-visible`

Toggle mask visibility.

```bash
trcc display mask-visible KEY STATE
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `STATE` | 'on' or 'off' |

### `trcc display media-player`

Set the media-player source — a local file or a web URL/stream. Wraps `SetMediaPlayer`: a local file plays through the video pipeline; a web URL is referenced (persisted so `theme save` captures it). An empty URI clears the source.

```bash
trcc display media-player KEY [URI]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `URI` | Source: a local file path, or a web URL/stream. '' clears. *(optional)* |

### `trcc display overlay`

Toggle the metric overlay layer.

```bash
trcc display overlay KEY STATE
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `STATE` | 'on' or 'off' |

### `trcc display overlay-add`

Add a user-edited overlay element to a device.

```bash
trcc display overlay-add [OPTIONS] KEY TYPE_
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `TYPE_` | 'text' / 'metric' / 'clock' |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--x` `X` | X position |
| `--y` `Y` | Y position |
| `--text` `TEXT` | Text content (type=text) |
| `--metric` `METRIC` | Metric id (type=metric) |
| `--format` `FMT` | Metric format string |

| `--size` `SIZE` | -- |
| `--bold` | -- |
| `--italic` | -- |
| `--show-unit` | Draw the metric's unit (°C/%/MHz/RPM) after the number, or the bare number when the unit is baked into the theme art |
| `--id` `ELEMENT_ID` | Explicit element id (default: auto-generated UUID) |

### `trcc display overlay-background`

Set the solid color used when background-mode=color.

```bash
trcc display overlay-background KEY HEX_COLOR
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `HEX_COLOR` | Hex color (e.g. 000000 for black) |

### `trcc display overlay-delete`

Remove a user-edited overlay element by id.

```bash
trcc display overlay-delete KEY ELEMENT_ID
```

| Argument | Description |

| `ELEMENT_ID` | -- |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--duration`, `-d` `DURATION_MS` | Flash duration in milliseconds |

### `trcc display overlay-render`

Render a DC config to a PNG preview — no active device required. Mirrors legacy `trcc overlay` — composites every element from `config1.dc` onto a solid-black canvas at *width × height* and writes the result as PNG. Useful when iterating on a theme's metric positions without unplugging the device or sending frames.

```bash
trcc display overlay-render [OPTIONS] DC_PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `DC_PATH` | DC file or theme directory containing config1.dc |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--output`, `-o` `OUTPUT` | Output PNG path for the rendered preview. |
| `--width`, `-w` `WIDTH` | Render canvas width (px) |
| `--height`, `-h` `HEIGHT` | Render canvas height (px) |

### `trcc display overlay-update`

Mutate fields on an existing user-edited overlay element.

```bash
trcc display overlay-update [OPTIONS] KEY ELEMENT_ID
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | -- |

Pause or resume video playback.

```bash
trcc display pause-video KEY STATE
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key |
| `STATE` | 'on' (pause) or 'off' (resume) |

### `trcc display play`

Run the render-and-send ticker until Ctrl-C. Dispatches TickDisplay every tick with live sensors — that Command advances an active video playback and renders, so the loop needs no handle on MediaService. Keeps SCSI devices from timing out (static-blink fix). Stops cleanly on SIGINT.

```bash
trcc display play [OPTIONS] KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--interval`, `-i` `INTERVAL` | Tick interval in seconds (default: AppSettings.refresh_interval_s) |

### `trcc display play-video`

Decode a video and start playing it on the device. Overrides the active theme's background until `stop-video` runs. Frames advance on each `display play` tick.

```bash
trcc display play-video [OPTIONS] KEY PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `PATH` | Video path (mp4/mov/webm/mkv/avi/zt) |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--fps` `FPS` | Decode FPS (default: 15) |

### `trcc display restore-theme`

Reload the device's persisted theme — convenience after restart.

```bash
trcc display restore-theme KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

### `trcc display resume`

Send each detected device's last-used theme (headless, no GUI). Use case: cron / systemd unit / udev hook that runs at boot or after a suspend cycle. Enumerates every TRCC-known device on the bus, connects, and replays the saved theme so the displays come back to their pre-boot / pre-suspend state without the GUI. Bulk/LY devices fade after ~2-3 s without a fresh frame — pair this with `trcc display keepalive` per device for those, or `trcc display play` for the full render-loop.

```bash
trcc display resume [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--retries` `RETRIES` | Discovery attempts before giving up (1 attempt = 2 s delay) |

### `trcc display screencast`

Stream a screen region to the LCD until interrupted. Wraps `StartScreencast` — the GUI `ScreencastHandler` subscriber drives the per-frame Qt capture timer. Ctrl-C calls `StopScreencast` for clean teardown.

```bash
trcc display screencast [OPTIONS] KEY X Y W H
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `X` | Top-left X coordinate of capture region (px) |
| `Y` | Top-left Y coordinate of capture region (px) |
| `W` | Capture region width (px) |
| `H` | Capture region height (px) |

```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key |
| `FRAME` | Frame index to jump to |

### `trcc display send-image`

Push an image to the LCD once — no theme staging, no persistence. Companion to `load-image` (which materialises a single-image theme and persists `DeviceSettings.current_theme`). Use this when you want ephemeral display: boot logos, quick previews, API upload pipelines.

```bash
trcc display send-image KEY PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `PATH` | Image file (PNG/JPG/BMP/WEBP) |

### `trcc display set-brightness`

```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `MODE` | Fit mode: 'width' (letterbox), 'height' (pillarbox), 'stretch' |

### `trcc display sleep`

Blank the panel so it goes dark (the shutdown / turn-off action). Sends a solid-black frame (LCD) or an all-off payload (LED) — the same Command the GUI + daemon fire at PC shutdown so the screen doesn't hold its last image lit. Idempotent; auto-connects in a fresh process.

```bash
trcc display sleep KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

| `STATE` | 'on' / 'off' |

### `trcc display slideshow-drive`

Actually rotate the configured slideshow, until stopped. `slideshow on` and `configure-slideshow` only PERSIST the slideshow. Nothing advanced it outside the gui — the gui runs its own timer, so a slideshow set up here was saved, reported back correctly, and never switched a theme. This registers the driver that rotates it. Unlike `slideshow-run` (a foreground demo loop over a directory), this uses the persisted config and returns immediately; the rotation continues in the background for as long as the app or daemon is alive.

```bash
trcc display slideshow-drive [OPTIONS] KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--stop` | Stop driving instead of starting |

### `trcc display slideshow-run`

Foreground slideshow over a directory of themes. Different from `slideshow` / `configure-slideshow` (which persist state). This is a one-shot loop: blocks until Ctrl-C, swaps to the next theme each tick. Useful for demos + smoke tests; the persisted flow is what production users want.

```bash
trcc display slideshow-run [OPTIONS] KEY THEMES_DIR
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `THEMES_DIR` | Directory containing theme subdirectories |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--interval`, `-i` `INTERVAL` | Seconds between theme switches (default: 30.0) |

```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

### `trcc display test`

Color-cycle the LCD: red → green → blue → black. Smallest end-to-end exercise of the wire chain. Useful when porting a new device class to confirm handshake → frame build → USB send all work before fighting overlay/theme bugs.

```bash
trcc display test [OPTIONS] KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--seconds`, `-s` `SECONDS` | Hold each color for this many seconds. |

### `trcc display test-lcd`

Print an ANSI true-color preview of the LCD's current render. Same pipeline as `display play` but stops at the renderer surface — no wire send. Useful for headless / sshell debugging where you can't see the physical device.

```bash
trcc display test-lcd [OPTIONS] KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key |
| `SOURCE` | Mask image file to copy + apply |

### `trcc display video-status`

Report what the device's video playback is doing (read-only). Answers "is a video loaded, where is it, how fast" without rendering a frame — the query half of the video surface, alongside `play-video` / `stop-video` / `pause-video` / `seek-video` / `loop-video`.

```bash
trcc led play [OPTIONS] KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | LED device key, e.g. 0416:8001 |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--interval`, `-i` `INTERVAL` | Tick interval in seconds (default: AppSettings.refresh_interval_s) |

### `trcc led render`

Render one LED frame from current settings + sensors and send. Reads the device's saved mode / color / brightness from Settings, advances the engine's phase counters on `app.led_runtime`, and sends one tick. Pass `--color` to override the saved color (treated as STATIC at full brightness — diagnostic shape).

```bash

```bash
trcc led test-led KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | LED device key, e.g. 0416:8001 |

### `trcc led test-mode`

Toggle the 4-color diagnostic test cycle.

```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | LED device key |
| `STATE` | 'on' or 'off' |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--interval`, `-i` `INTERVAL` | Set ticks-per-rotation alongside the toggle |

### `trcc led zone-sync-zones`

Choose WHICH zones take part in the zone-sync carousel. `zone-sync` turns the carousel on and sets its interval; this says which pages rotate in it. Without this, that choice existed only in the gui.

```bash
trcc led zone-sync-zones KEY ZONES
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | LED device key |
| `ZONES` | Comma-separated on/off per zone, e.g. 'on,off,on,on' |

## `trcc system`

System-level operations (setup, sensors, info).

### `trcc system autostart`

Manage auto-launch-on-login (XDG .desktop on Linux).

#### `trcc system autostart disable`

Remove the autostart entry.

```bash
trcc system autostart disable
```

#### `trcc system autostart enable`

Install the autostart entry (per-user, no sudo required). All four UIs can start at login; without `--target` the entry launches the gui, which is what it always did.

```bash
trcc system autostart enable [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--target`, `-t` `TARGET` | Which UI starts with the computer (api, daemon, gui, qtgui). Default: gui. |

#### `trcc system autostart refresh`

Re-render an existing entry so it picks up a new launch path. The repair for a moved install (#201): an entry written by an older install keeps its old `Exec=` forever. Does NOT enable autostart — with no entry installed it reports so and changes nothing.

```bash
trcc system autostart refresh
```

#### `trcc system autostart status`

Show whether auto-launch-on-login is enabled.

```bash
trcc system autostart status
```

### `trcc system check-update`

Ask GitHub Releases whether a newer version is available.

```bash
trcc system check-update
```

### `trcc system dashboard`

Print the sensor-dashboard layout — panels, rows and their bindings. The grid the GUI's System Info screen edits, stored at `<config_dir>/system_config.json`. Unbound rows render as `--` in the GUI and are shown here as `<unbound>`: the row's target sensor does not exist on this machine (no DDR5 SPD temp, no SMART disk temp, fewer fan headers than slots). Reading is non-destructive — auto-mapping is recomputed every time and NOT written back, so the layout heals itself when hardware changes. Pass `--save-auto-map` to freeze what you see.

```bash
trcc system dashboard [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--save-auto-map` | Persist the auto-mapped bindings instead of only showing them. |

### `trcc system debug-report`

Generate a debug report bundle for GitHub issues.

```bash
trcc system debug-report [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--output`, `-o` `OUTPUT` | Write the report to this path instead of stdout. Recommended when filing a GitHub issue — attach the file. |
| `--log-lines` `LOG_LINES` | How many trailing log lines to include (default 1000). |

### `trcc system doctor`

Run health checks — exits 1 on any FAIL. The reporter-friendly summary tells you what's wrong + how to fix it. For a copy-paste GitHub-issue dump, use `system debug-report` instead.

```bash
trcc system doctor
```

### `trcc system download`

Pre-fetch the theme + cloud + mask archives for a resolution. DiscoverDevices runs this implicitly the first time a device of a given resolution attaches. Call it directly to populate the local cache while you have network — handy for headless setups that'll later run offline. Idempotent.

```bash
trcc system download WIDTH HEIGHT
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `WIDTH` | Display width (px), e.g. 320 |
| `HEIGHT` | Display height (px), e.g. 320 |

### `trcc system first-run-status`

Show whether trcc has been set up on this machine yet.

```bash
trcc system first-run-status
```

### `trcc system hdd-enabled`

Toggle inclusion of HDD metrics in sensor broadcasts.

```bash
trcc system hdd-enabled STATE
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `STATE` | 'on' or 'off' |

### `trcc system health`

Quick read-only health report — same checks as `doctor`, no exit code.

```bash
trcc system health
```

### `trcc system hid-debug`

Connect to *key* + print handshake details for a GitHub issue paste. Composes `ConnectDevice` (returns handshake bytes + parsed resolution / model id / serial) and `LcdSnapshot` to dump the persisted state. Output is plain text — copy + paste-friendly.

```bash
trcc system hid-debug KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

### `trcc system info`

Show current sensor metrics (CPU/GPU/fan/disk/net readings). Mirrors legacy `trcc info` — dispatches `ReadSensors` and prints each reading. Use `--metric <prefix>` to narrow the output; pass no args for everything. For paths / install info / permissions, see `trcc system platform-info`.

```bash
trcc system info [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--metric`, `-m` `METRIC` | Filter readings whose `sensor_id` startswith this prefix (e.g. cpu, gpu, mem, disk, net, fan, time). |

### `trcc system lang`

Print the currently-active UI language code. Read-only — for "what language is TRCC in right now?" without digging through `snapshot`. Use `set-language` to change it.

```bash
trcc system lang
```

### `trcc system led-debug`

LED device handshake + zone/segment dump + optional test cycle. Composes `ConnectDevice` and `LedSnapshot` for a one- shot diagnostic. Pass `--test-colors` to cycle the device's test pattern so you can confirm wire-up visually.

```bash
trcc system led-debug [OPTIONS] KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | LED device key, e.g. 0416:8001 |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--test-colors` | After handshake, enable the 4-color test cycle (Ctrl-C to stop). |

### `trcc system list-disk-sensors`

List drive THERMAL sensors — the list disk_temp comes from. Not the same as 'list-disks', which enumerates mounted partitions and shares no key with this list. Pick one of these with 'trcc config disk'.

```bash
trcc system list-disk-sensors
```

### `trcc system list-disks`

List mounted partitions — NOT the drive list `disk_temp` comes from.

```bash
trcc system list-disks
```

### `trcc system list-endpoints`

Enumerate every HTTP route the REST API exposes. Builds the FastAPI app (no uvicorn) and walks its router so the output reflects what `trcc api` / `trcc serve` would serve.

```bash
trcc system list-endpoints
```

### `trcc system list-fans`

List fans the sensors aggregator exposes, with live readings. Read-only diagnostic (#145/#207) — snapshot() maps fans to theme slots automatically (GPU slot follows the picked GPU); this shows what the box exposes.

```bash
trcc system list-fans
```

### `trcc system list-fonts`

List font families Qt can see.

```bash
trcc system list-fonts
```

### `trcc system list-gpus`

List GPUs exposed by the sensors aggregator.

```bash
trcc system list-gpus
```

### `trcc system list-languages`

List every UI language the i18n table supports.

```bash
trcc system list-languages
```

### `trcc system list-sensors`

Print every sensor the platform enumerates — descriptors only. Read-only enumeration: no polling, no values. Pair with `system sensors` (or `system info --metric <prefix>`) when you want the current readings instead.

```bash
trcc system list-sensors
```

### `trcc system mark-setup-done`

Tell trcc the welcome flow has been completed.

```bash
trcc system mark-setup-done
```

### `trcc system memory-slots`

List DRAM slots — size/type/speed/manufacturer, plus timings on Linux. Timings (tCAS/tRCD/tRP/tRAS/tRC/tRFC) come from SPD + the live memory controller and are Linux-only today; other platforms show NC. This is what the LC1-style memory panel renders, and it is worth pasting into a bug report about that panel.

```bash
trcc system memory-slots
```

### `trcc system paths`

Show where this install keeps config, data, logs and user content. Answers "where did my theme go?" and "which log do I attach to an issue?" without the user guessing at `~/.trcc` versus `~/.trcc-user`. With `--key` the answer is that device's: the resolution comes from its handshake (oriented) and the theme/cloud dirs name its per-SKU library, so the output points at the directories the app actually opens for it.

```bash
trcc system paths [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--resolution`, `-r` `RESOLUTION` | WxH (e.g. 854x480) — also show the per-resolution theme/mask dirs |
| `--key`, `-k` `KEY` | Device key (e.g. 0402:3922) — use that cooler's own artwork libraries, and its resolution when --resolution is omitted |

### `trcc system platform-info`

Show platform info (distro, install method, config dir, permissions).

```bash
trcc system platform-info
```

### `trcc system sensors`

Print current sensor readings.

```bash
trcc system sensors
```

### `trcc system setup`

Run the OS-specific setup (udev rules on Linux, WinUSB guide on Windows).

```bash
trcc system setup [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--yes`, `-y` | Non-interactive (assume yes to prompts) |

### `trcc system snapshot`

Print the AppSettings snapshot (language, GPU, refresh interval).

```bash
trcc system snapshot [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Emit JSON instead of human text. |

### `trcc system upgrade`

Upgrade trcc-linux via the detected package manager.

```bash
trcc system upgrade [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip confirmation and run the upgrade subprocess. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the command that would run, don't execute it. |

## `trcc theme`

Save / export / import themes.

### `trcc theme cloud-download`

Cache a cloud theme locally WITHOUT applying it to a device. `cloud-load` downloads AND applies — it persists the background and starts playback. This is the download half on its own: useful for pre-fetching a catalog over a slow link, or warming the cache before a demo, without disturbing what a panel is currently showing. Needs no device and no connection. Idempotent: an already-cached theme is not fetched again. `--resolution` is the ORIENTED catalog size the cloud library is keyed by (854x480 and 480x854 are different libraries), not necessarily the panel's native size.

```bash
trcc theme cloud-download [OPTIONS] THEME_ID
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `THEME_ID` | Cloud theme id, e.g. a001 |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--resolution`, `-r` `RESOLUTION` | Oriented catalog size, e.g. 320x320 or 480x854. |

### `trcc theme cloud-downloaded`

List the cloud themes actually DOWNLOADED for this device. `cloud-list` shows Thermalright's hosted catalog — what EXISTS. This shows what is on disk for the canvas, which is a different question and had no answer outside the REST API. The directory is REPORTED by the query rather than re-spelled from the resolution: a per-SKU panel reads `1600720l` while one whose variant archive has not landed falls back to the generic name.

```bash
trcc theme cloud-downloaded [OPTIONS] KEY
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--resolution`, `-r` `RESOLUTION` | Canvas to list for (e.g. 320x320). Needed when the device isn't connected — a scan reports no canvas, only a handshake does. |

### `trcc theme cloud-list`

List themes in Thermalright's hosted catalog.

```bash
trcc theme cloud-list [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--category`, `-c` `CATEGORY` | Category prefix: 'all' / 'a' / 'b' / 'c' / 'd' / 'e' / 'y' |

### `trcc theme cloud-load`

Download a cloud theme and load it on a device.

```bash
trcc theme cloud-load KEY THEME_ID
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `THEME_ID` | Cloud theme id, e.g. a001 |

### `trcc theme create`

One-shot theme builder: bg + optional mask + overlay metrics → save. Mirrors legacy `trcc theme --save`. Dispatches a chain of existing Commands: `LoadImage` for the background, `UploadCustomMask` if `--mask` given, `AddOverlayElement` per `--metric` arg, then `SaveTheme` to persist the result. Stops on the first failure and leaves the device in whatever state was reached.

```bash
trcc theme create [OPTIONS] KEY NAME
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `NAME` | Theme name to save as |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--bg`, `-b` `BACKGROUND` | Background image (PNG/JPG/BMP/WEBP) |
| `--mask` `MASK` | Optional mask PNG to overlay (custom_<name>/01.png) |
| `--metric`, `-m` `METRIC` | Overlay metric spec: 'metric_key:x,y[:color[:size]]' — e.g. 'cpu:temp:160,90:#ff8800:24'. color defaults to '#ffffff', size defaults to 16. Repeatable. |

### `trcc theme delete`

Delete a theme directory. Path-based to match legacy's `delete_theme(lcd, path)` — the caller already has the resolved path from `theme list` output.

```bash
trcc theme delete PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `PATH` | Absolute path to the theme directory to delete |

### `trcc theme export`

Zip a theme into an archive file.

```bash
trcc theme export KEY THEME_NAME ARCHIVE_PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key (e.g. 0402:3922) whose resolution scopes the lookup |
| `THEME_NAME` | Theme name (directory under user_theme_dir(w, h)) |
| `ARCHIVE_PATH` | Destination archive path (e.g. theme.tr) |

### `trcc theme export-config`

Snapshot one device's settings to a JSON file. Captures everything in `DeviceSettings`: active theme path, brightness, orientation, overlay edits, mask choice, format prefs. Pair with `trcc theme import-config` to restore on another host or after a wipe.

```bash
trcc theme export-config KEY OUTPUT_PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `OUTPUT_PATH` | Destination JSON path (e.g. mydevice.json) |

### `trcc theme export-dc`

Write a theme out as legacy `config1.dc` for Windows TRCC users.

```bash
trcc theme export-dc KEY THEME_NAME OUTPUT_PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key (e.g. 0402:3922) — its resolution scopes the lookup and layers the user's overlay elements into the export |
| `THEME_NAME` | Theme name (directory under user_theme_dir(w, h)) |
| `OUTPUT_PATH` | Where to write the config1.dc file |

### `trcc theme export-overlay`

Export just a theme's overlay layout (the metric grid) for sharing — lighter than the whole-theme zip and distinct from the DC binary.

```bash
trcc theme export-overlay KEY THEME_NAME OUTPUT_PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key (e.g. 0402:3922) — its resolution scopes the lookup |
| `THEME_NAME` | Theme name (directory under user_theme_dir(w, h)) |
| `OUTPUT_PATH` | Where to write the overlay layout file |

### `trcc theme import`

Unpack a theme archive into the device's per-resolution theme dir.

```bash
trcc theme import KEY ARCHIVE_PATH [NAME]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key (e.g. 0402:3922) whose resolution scopes the target |
| `ARCHIVE_PATH` | Archive to unpack |
| `NAME` | Theme name (defaults to archive filename stem) *(optional)* |

### `trcc theme import-config`

Restore one device's settings from an export-config JSON file.

```bash
trcc theme import-config KEY INPUT_PATH
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key, e.g. 0402:3922 |
| `INPUT_PATH` | Source JSON written by `trcc theme export-config` |

### `trcc theme list`

List themes for a device resolution. By default scans both `data/theme{W}{H}` (pkg + GitHub-downloaded) and `user_content_dir/data/theme{W}{H}` (legacy user-saved location) so installed-user themes show up alongside fresh downloads.

```bash
trcc theme list [OPTIONS] [KEY]
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key (e.g. 0402:3922) — its resolution scopes the scan. Required unless --dir is given. *(optional)* |

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `--dir`, `-d` `DIRECTORY` | Override: scan an explicit directory instead of the device's theme dirs. |

### `trcc theme save`

Duplicate the device's active theme directory under a new name.

```bash
trcc theme save KEY NAME
```

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `KEY` | Device key whose active theme to save |
| `NAME` | New theme name (directory under user_content_dir) |
