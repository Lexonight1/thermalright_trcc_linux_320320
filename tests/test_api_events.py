"""``WS /events`` — the observe half the REST API never had.

The API could dispatch and it could read.  Everything a UI learns without
asking reached the Qt skins through ``BusBridge`` and the CLI through
``AppProxy.events``, and reached a REST client not at all — so a browser
dashboard had to poll, and could not see anything transient at all: a video
export publishes each progress step once and never repeats it.

What these tests hold to:

* the envelope is ``ipc.encode_event``'s, byte-identical to what the daemon's
  Unix socket sends — one wire format, not two;
* an unknown ``types=`` name is REFUSED rather than silently subscribing the
  client to a stream that will never carry anything;
* the subscription is released when the socket goes, because an EventBus
  fanning out to a closed connection leaks for the life of the process.
