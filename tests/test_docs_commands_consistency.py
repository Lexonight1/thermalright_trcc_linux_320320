"""Docs must describe the contract that exists.

``doc/REFERENCE_COMMANDS.md`` is the page an outside contributor needs to build
their own UI: the one surface every UI dispatches against, with each Command's
kind, fields and Result.  Before it existed there was no page for it at all —
while a file named ``doc/TRCC_CONTRACT.md`` described a ``Trcc`` facade and
three Command classes deleted in the cutover.  Someone would have written code
against them before finding out; it was removed when this landed.

Same contract as the man pages, the CLI reference and the port reference: the
committed copy must match what the generator produces right now.
