"""gui()/qtgui() must exit via SystemExit, not typer.Exit (#187).

They're direct entry points — the Windows ``trcc-gui.exe`` frozen ``__main__``
and the ``trcc-gui``/``trcc-lcd`` console scripts call them OUTSIDE typer's
runner.  ``typer.Exit`` only means something inside that runner; raised here it
escapes unhandled and the frozen ``__main__``'s ``except Exception`` re-raises
it as "Failed to execute script".  ``SystemExit`` (a ``BaseException``, not an
``Exception``) exits cleanly in every context and carries launch()'s code.
