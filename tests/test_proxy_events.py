"""``AppProxy.events`` — the client half of the observe channel.

Both Qt skins build a ``BusBridge(app.events)`` at construction.  Until this
existed that was an ``AttributeError`` on a proxy, so a GUI could not run as a
daemon client at all — which is the whole reason ``TRCC_DAEMON=1`` stayed off
by default and the Command bus stayed optional rather than mandatory.

What is pinned here is what a reader cannot see from the code: that events
arrive as REAL typed instances (``BusBridge`` subscribes by type, so a dict
would silently deliver nothing), that opening the stream is lazy (a CLI
one-shot must not pay for a subscription it never reads), and that a dead
stream is surfaced rather than leaving a GUI looking connected while every
panel quietly stops updating.
