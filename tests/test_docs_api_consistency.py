"""Docs must describe the API that exists.

Measured against the running app, the hand-written ``doc/REFERENCE_API.md``
claimed **59 routes of which 55 did not exist**, and documented **4 of the
133** the app actually serves.  It also sent readers to port 9876 when the
server has defaulted to 8080 for a long time.  It was ungated, so nothing ever
said so.

Same contract as the man pages and the CLI, port and command references: the
committed copy must match what the generator produces right now.
