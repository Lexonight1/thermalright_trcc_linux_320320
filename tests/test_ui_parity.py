"""UI parity gate — a capability should be reachable from every UI.

The four UIs are one app wearing four faces (see ``METHOD_UI.md``): a user
capability is ONE core Command, dispatched by every UI that could want it.  A
Command only one UI reaches is a capability the other surfaces' users cannot
have, and #150 was exactly that class of bug.

**This file holds THE record of accepted exceptions.**  It used to hold half of
one.  A second list — ``KNOWN_SINGLE_CLIENT_COMMANDS`` in
``test_architecture_boundaries`` — was added 2026-08-28 to ask the same question
across all four trees, which is the "future gate" an earlier version of this
docstring asked for; it was built beside this list rather than replacing it, and
the two shared only 4 of 21 names.  Merged here 2026-08-30, because one rule
recorded twice drifts, and this pair already had.
