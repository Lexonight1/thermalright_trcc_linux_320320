"""Logging coverage may only improve — the ratchet.

**Why this is enforced rather than remembered.**  Users diagnose through
``trcc report``, which pastes the log file.  For hardware we do not own that
paste IS the diagnosis, so a function with no log line is a bug report we
cannot answer.  The rule is therefore: *every function, new or old, gets a log
line* — and a rule nobody can fail is a rule that rots.

It cannot start green: 1451 of 3074 countable functions were silent when this
landed.  Failing on all of them would put CI permanently red, which is how a
gate gets ignored.  So it is a **ratchet**:

* add a silent function -> the count rises -> **fail**
* give a silent function a log line -> the count falls -> **fail**, asking you
  to lower :data:`MAX_SILENT` so the ground you gained cannot be lost

The number lives here, in the test, so every diff that moves it shows the
direction of travel.  It should only ever go down.

Exclusions are in ``dev/tools/logging_coverage.py`` and each has a cause:
abstract methods and stubs never ran, and dunders the logger invokes while
formatting a record (``__repr__``, ``__len__``, …) would recurse forever.

#: Silent functions as of 2026-08-21 (landed at 1451; -5 by deleting six dead
#: functions, -7 by promoting eleven ``Platform`` members to ``@abstractmethod``
#: — an abstract method has no body, so it stops being countable, and the seven
#: silent ones among them stopped being excuses).  LOWER THIS as coverage
#: improves; never raise it.  Worst areas now:
#: ui 681, adapters 420, services 122, core 101.
#: 1344 -> 1343 on 2026-09-01: retiring ``SetDiskIndex`` deleted its silent
#: ``execute``.  A removal lowers this exactly as a fix does — the ratchet
#: asserts BOTH directions, so ground given back is a failure either way.
#: 1343 -> 1342 on 2026-09-02: ``DisconnectDevice.execute`` got the entry log
#: THE RULE requires, in the pass that gave it the shutdown blank.  It was the
#: one device-release path that reported nothing about why it did what it did.
#: 1342 -> 1341 the same day: ``ResetDevice.execute`` likewise, when it stopped
#: being a copy of DisconnectDevice and became a real disconnect-reconnect-
#: restore cycle whose three steps each need to be readable in a report.
#: 1341 -> 1340 on 2026-09-02: ``ListLedStyles.execute`` reported nothing while
#: it was telling users an 8-of-12 wrong answer, so the line names the zone
#: counts it resolved rather than that it ran.
#: 1340 -> 1339 the same day: ``TRCCApp._create_i18n_overlays`` builds the whole
#: About pane and the language picker and said nothing, so a report could not
#: show which language the labels were rendered in.
