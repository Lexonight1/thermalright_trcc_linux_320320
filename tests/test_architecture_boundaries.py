"""Architecture boundary gate — the hexagon's dependency law, made executable.

CLAUDE.md states the layer law in prose: ``core`` depends on nothing in the
app; ``services`` depend only on ``core``; dependencies point inward only.
Prose does not fail the build, so the law eroded over time — lazy adapter
imports buried inside core Command bodies (hidden from a top-level grep), a
PySide6 import in a core Command, an ``sys.platform`` OS-sniff in core.  This
test makes the law executable: it parses every module under ``core/`` and
``services/`` with ``ast`` and fails on

  * any *runtime* import that resolves into ``trcc.adapters`` / ``trcc.ui`` or a
    GUI / OS / USB framework package, and
  * any ``sys.platform`` / ``platform.system()``-style OS-sniff,

because both reverse the inward dependency arrow / belong behind a port.

Imports inside ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` are skipped — they never execute, so they
create no *runtime* dependency arrow (the architecturally correct fix may still
move such types into ``core``, but they don't rot the runtime hexagon).

Ratchet pattern: the breaches that exist today are listed in the ``KNOWN_*``
allowlists, so the gate is GREEN immediately and protective from the first
commit — any NEW breach not on the list fails the build.  Fixing a breach means
DELETING its allowlist entry; a *stale* entry (listed but no longer present in
the code) also fails the test, so the lists can only burn down to empty, never
accumulate dead weight.  When both lists are empty, the core ring is sealed.

    #
    # cli/api: SEVEN sites appeared on 2026-08-31, against a docstring that
    # said "measured at zero".  Six had Commands that already existed and are
    # burned down the same day — autostart x2 -> GetAutostartStatus,
    # devices x2 -> ListDevices, devices x2 -> DeviceState (one shared
    # ``_ctx.resolution_for`` helper: the two CLI blocks were byte-identical
    # for 11 of 12 lines).  ONE remains, and it is not debt:
    "ui/api/display.py": 1,          # platform.paths() — CodeQL barrier, #239
    # gui/qtgui lifecycle — deliberately OUT of burn-down.  A GUI running as a
    # daemon *client* must not own app lifecycle, and an event stream over a
    # socket is a different problem from a data read.
    # 2026-09-04: gui 4 -> 2 and qtgui 8 -> 5.  ``App.start_session()`` gave
    # ``close()`` the partner it never had, so the four-call bring-up block
    # that was copy-pasted into run_daemon / run_gui / run_qtgui is ONE call
    # in one place.  Ground gained, not given back.
    "ui/gui/__init__.py": 2,         # start_session / close
    "ui/gui/lcd_handler.py": 1,      # .renderer — a Command-signature question
    "ui/gui/splash.py": 1,           # discover_and_connect — lifecycle
    "ui/qtgui/app.py": 5,            # events / first_run / platform / start_session / close
    # 11 -> 9 on 2026-08-30: UCThemeMask stopped being handed a Paths port and
    # a ContentStore.  It composed "which masks does this device have" out of
    # both; ``ListMasks`` had answered that all along for cli/api/qtgui.  What
    # unblocked it was completing the RESULT — ``FileEntry`` gained
    # ``is_custom``, the one field the panel still needed and the Command had
    # been discarding.  A UI reaches past the bus exactly when the Result is
    # short a field.
    # 9 -> 16 on 2026-08-31 by rules 2+4 alone (app.platform x5, app.events,
    # _app_local.cloud_themes) — visibility, not regression.
    # 16 -> 14 the same day: the About panel stopped being handed a Platform
    # port, and ``ensure_autostart`` takes the App and dispatches.  The
    # second of those was INVISIBLE to the old collector (rule 2).
    # 14 -> 13 on 2026-08-31: the LED panel asks ``ListMemorySlots``
    # instead of being handed ``platform.memory_info``.  The DISK half of
    # that same injection deliberately stays: its dropdown is sourced from
    # physical drives while the index it writes addresses nothing, so a
    # Query there would plumb a dead control (increment 4d).
    # 13 -> 8 on 2026-08-31: all five ``.devices`` reaches gone.  The
    # handlers take a device KEY and ask the bus — the swap
    # ``BaseHandler.__init__`` had carried a TODO for ("Phase 5 swaps it
    # for a key string so handlers can dispatch through the App without
    # holding device refs").  What remains is lifecycle + the screencast
    # RawFrame signature question, both deliberately out.
    # 8 -> 7 on 2026-08-31: the LED panel's disk dropdown is sourced from
    # ``ListDiskSensors`` — the THERMAL list the metric actually comes
    # from — so the panel is handed no Platform port at all.
    "ui/gui/trcc_app.py": 7,
    # led/_base.py and led_panel.py reached ZERO on 2026-08-31: the six LED
    # tabs take a ``LedSnapshotResult`` instead of a live ``LedDeviceSettings``.
    # Same rule as UCThemeMask before them — the Result was short four fields
    # (segment_on, clock_24h, week_sunday, memory_ratio), and a
    # panel holds a domain object exactly as long as the Result does not
    # answer it.

# ── Every capability belongs to every UI → tests/test_ui_parity.py ─────────
#
# ``KNOWN_SINGLE_CLIENT_COMMANDS`` and its tests lived here from 2026-08-28 to
# 2026-08-30.  They asked "which Commands does only one UI reach?", which is UI
# PARITY and not a layer boundary — and ``test_ui_parity`` had been asking a
# narrower version of the same question, with written reasons, since
# 2026-07-12.  Two records of one rule drift, and these had: they shared 4 of 21
# names, and one reason had gone false without anything failing.
#
# They are now ONE record — ``KNOWN_UI_ASYMMETRY`` — which stores the UI reach
# per Command, derives single-client / CLI-only / API-only from it, and asserts
# the recorded reach against reality so a reason cannot expire in silence.
#
# This file keeps what it is named for: layer imports, OS sniffing, filesystem
# I/O, gui reaches past dispatch, and Gate A (a UI importing an adapter, which
# IS an import boundary).


# ── A str-enum in a Result: what actually breaks, and what does not ─────────
#
# ``LedStyle`` subclasses ``str``, so a Result field holding one arrives
# IN-PROCESS as the enum while the SAME Result crossing the daemon socket is
# JSON and lands as a plain ``'ax120'``.
#
# Half of the obvious worry is FALSE, and the test says so on purpose: a
# str-enum hashes and compares equal to its own value, so a dict keyed by the
# enum is looked up perfectly well by the bare string.  It was written the
# other way first, asserting a silent miss, and running it disproved that.
#
# What does break is attribute access — ``.name`` on a plain string raises.
# So a UI reading such a field rebuilds the enum from the value.
