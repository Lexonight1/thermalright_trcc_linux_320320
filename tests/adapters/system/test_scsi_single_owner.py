"""LinuxScsiTransport takes a single-owner advisory claim on the sg node.

SCSI generic has NO kernel-level exclusion — measured on real hardware, two
processes can each ``os.open`` /dev/sgN and both write frames, which interleave
with no error and nothing logged.  ``open()`` therefore takes an advisory
``flock`` and refuses when another TRCC process already holds it.

``flock`` is a property of the file description, not of the driver, so a
regular file is a faithful stand-in for the device node here: two ``open()``
calls contend exactly as two processes on /dev/sgN do.  That is what makes this
testable with no hardware and no root.
