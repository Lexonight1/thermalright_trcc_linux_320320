"""The UI bus — ``UserInterface`` + the ``UIS`` registry.

UI was always the third adapter family beside OS and Device, and the only one
without an ABC: five hand-written bring-up sequences with five signatures.
``App.start_session`` exists *because* that duplication drifted -- one copy
lost ``metrics_loop.start()`` and a reporter's daemon served a permanently
blank device (#148).  These gates hold the shape that prevents a sixth copy.
