"""ExportVideoClip / ProbeVideoDuration — video export as a bus capability.

Before these Commands, a ``.zt`` encode existed three times: the service,
a qtgui QThread around it, and a gui copy that hand-rolled both the ffmpeg
invocation and the container writer.  None of the three was reachable from
the CLI or the API, so two of the four UIs could not export a video at all.

The tests that matter here are about the SHAPE, not the pixels:

* the Command returns as soon as the clip is queued, because ffmpeg runs
  for minutes and the IPC dispatch timeout is 30 s;
* every guard answers at the call site rather than seconds later from a
  worker thread, where the caller has already returned;
* the outcome — success or failure — arrives on the EventBus under the
  token the Result handed back.

The encode itself is exercised end-to-end when ffmpeg is present
(``test_real_encode_round_trips``); everything else runs without it.
