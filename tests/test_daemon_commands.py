"""Daemon lifecycle on the Command bus.

The daemon is this application's own software, not an OS facility, so its
lifecycle belongs on the bus like every other capability.  Before these
existed, ``cli`` and ``api`` imported ``daemon.kill_daemon`` /
``ipc.daemon_running`` directly and the two GUIs could not ask at all — so
"is a daemon running?" was a question only half the UIs could pose, about the
one process all four depend on.

The shape a UI wants at boot is *is the daemon up?  no — create it; yes —
talk to it*, and it has to be idempotent so every UI can dispatch it
unconditionally instead of probing first and racing its own spawn.
