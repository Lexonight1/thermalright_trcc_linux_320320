# Security & Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

We appreciate responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please follow these steps to report it safely:

1. If the vulnerability is high/critical or may expose sensitive data, open a private issue.
2. Include the scanner output (bandit_report.json, pip_audit_results.json, safety_report.json) and a minimal reproduction if possible.
3. Do not post public proof-of-concept code that exposes user data or credentials.
4. The maintainers aim to acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a remediation timeline.

In non-sensitive cases, you may open a public issue using the security report template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security-report.md`), and add the label `security`.

Thank you for helping keep TRCC Linux secure.
