"""Generate `doc/REFERENCE_API.md` from the live FastAPI app.

The fourth generated document, for the same reason as the other three, and
with the sharpest evidence of any of them.  Measured against the running app,
the hand-written page claimed **59 routes of which 55 did not exist**, and
documented **4 of the 133** the app actually serves.  It also told readers to
connect on port 9876; the server has defaulted to 8080 for a long time.  It was
last touched before the cutover and nothing gated it, so nobody found out.

Everything here is read off the app itself: the path, the methods, the tag it
is grouped under, the response model, the path parameters, and the endpoint's
own docstring.  A route with no docstring is listed bare rather than skipped —
the page must show the whole surface, and an undocumented endpoint should be
visible as one.

Deterministic: grouped by tag, sorted by path inside each group, no timestamp.
