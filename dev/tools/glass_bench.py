"""Instructions-per-frame on REAL hardware, measured differentially.

Answers "did this build get more expensive per rendered frame?" for two trees,
on the device, with the work counted independently.

    # one arm, current tree
    PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 dev/tools/glass_bench.py

    # compare against an older tree checked out in a worktree
    git worktree add --detach /tmp/v992 v9.9.2
    PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 dev/tools/glass_bench.py --against /tmp/v992/src

    # the workload the CPU hunt used
    PYTHONPATH=src python3.12 dev/tools/glass_bench.py --video ~/.trcc/data/web/320320/a008.mp4

NEVER measure CPU% to compare builds on a scaling box.  ``ps %cpu``, ``utime``
and ``task-clock`` measure TIME ON CPU, and `intel_pstate`/`powersave` moves the
clock with the load: silencing logging once measured 24%% fewer instructions and
36%% MORE time on CPU.  See memory ``project_cpu_regression_is_logging``.

This file exists because its predecessor did not.  The 2026-08-26 harness lived
in a session scratchpad and was gone by 2026-08-27; rebuilding it cost most of a
session, and rebuilding it re-introduced three instrument bugs that are now
comments in this file rather than lessons to relearn:

1.  **``DeviceSender._raw_write`` is the WRONG work counter.**  The sender is
    asynchronous and coalesces -- a tight loop logs "submit superseded a pending
    frame" and 1 tick in 30 reaches the wire.  It counts what the DEVICE
    accepted.  ``DisplayService.build_frame`` is the CPU work, once per tick.
2.  **Keep perf's output away from the harness's.**  A wrapper doing
    ``2>&1 >/dev/null`` swallows the work-parity line, and a measurement whose
    work count you cannot see is not a measurement.  ``perf -o FILE`` here.
3.  **A differential needs a span that dominates startup.**  At N=200 vs 400 the
    measured span was ~2 G against ~9 G of fixed startup, and three replicates of
    ONE build read 6.25 / 11.32 / 12.81 M/frame (+-34%%) -- useless for a 9%%
    effect.  At 1000 vs 3000 it is +-3%%.  An ffmpeg child inside the fixed part
    is the main variance source, so the static workload is the quieter one.
4.  **A cold ``--against`` tree reads FALSELY CHEAP.**  With no ``__pycache__``
    its first run compiles the whole tree; that run is ``lo``, so the
    differential subtracts a cost only ``i_lo`` paid and the slope comes out
    low.  Measured 2026-08-30: the second arm's rep1 read 1.192 / 1.387 / 1.203
    M/frame against ~1.85 once warm -- enough to report "1.2x MORE EXPENSIVE"
    for a change that added nothing to the frame path.  Two identical trees
    reproduced it and swapping the arms moved the "regression" to the other
    tree, which is what proved it was position and not code.
    ``_warm_bytecode`` compiles both arms before either is measured.

Hybrid P/E-core boxes report ``instructions:u`` per PMU (``cpu_atom`` /
``cpu_core``); both are summed here.  Validate with ``--selftest``, which checks
a synthetic workload scales linearly before you trust any app number.
