"""Bring up the REAL shipping GUI and drive a known number of rendered frames.

Shared by ``frame_profile.py --gui`` and ``record_rate.py --gui``.  Both need
the same thing — the actual window, its observers, its preview repaints and its
Qt event loop, rendering a fixed count — and differ only in what they do at the
warm-up boundary: one starts a profiler, the other marks a byte offset in the
log.  That difference is the ``on_mark`` callback; everything else is here so
there is one GUI drive to keep correct instead of two that drift.

``glass_bench._run_gui_arm`` deliberately does NOT use this.  It runs under
``perf`` in a subprocess and carries ``_logging_kwargs`` compatibility for trees
as old as v9.9.2, so it is a different job that happens to look similar.

**Why it is driven and not awaited.**  Letting the GUI tick at its own rate
makes the run length depend on whatever background the user last saved: with a
video it composed ~12 fps, and with none it fell back to the 2 s metrics tick,
where 900 frames is half an hour.  A zero-interval timer dispatching
``RenderAndSend`` makes the frame count the independent variable while every
observer, preview update and repaint still runs.

**Why it cannot go through ``trcc()``.**  That builds a ``QtRenderer``, which
creates a ``QGuiApplication``, and ``run()`` then refuses to construct a
``QApplication`` over it.

**The panel updates far more slowly than this renders**, and holds its last
frame once the run exits.  Neither is a bug: ``DeviceSender`` is asynchronous
and supersedes whatever frame is still pending, so only a fraction reach USB —
measured 200 frames built, 4 raw writes.  The renders are all real.

    ``on_mark`` fires once, after ``warmup`` frames and before the measured
    ones — the caller starts its profiler or records its log offset there.

    ``on_done`` fires once the frame target is reached and **before the window
    tears down**, and callers that measure anything need it.  ``run()`` does not
    return until the GUI has fully shut down, and shutdown is loud: closing the
    tray, stopping the metrics loop, the hotplug monitor, the LED loop, the
    sender, disconnecting the device.  A caller that stops measuring after
    ``run()`` returns therefore attributes all of that to the frame path —
    measured, it put 32 one-shot teardown records into a GUI record-rate that is
    otherwise 0.00, and it had ``frame_profile`` profiling the teardown too.

    The return value is the count actually rendered past the mark, which is the
    denominator a caller must divide by: measured, never assumed, because the
    event loop can process a tick or two after ``quit()``.
