"""Count functions in ``src/trcc`` that emit no log line.

**Why this is a gate and not a style note.**  Users send us ``trcc report``,
which pastes the log file.  That paste is the whole diagnosis for hardware we
do not own and cannot reproduce on.  A function with no log line is therefore
not "untidy" — it is a bug report we cannot answer, and a round-trip asking
someone to reproduce with a flag.

Exclusions, each for a CAUSE rather than for convenience:

* **abstract methods and stubs** — no body ran, so nothing happened to report.
* **dunders the logger itself calls while formatting** (``__repr__``,
  ``__str__``, ``__eq__``, ``__len__``, …).  Logging inside these recurses:
  the logger formats its arguments, which calls ``__repr__``, which logs,
  which formats.  This is a technical impossibility, not a preference.

Everything else counts.  A property getter counts.  ``__init__`` counts.

    # A first pass read ``_open`` as safe at 1 entry -- an artifact of a trial

    # peer process: take LOCK_EX twice on one fd, release once, and the peer
    # ACQUIRES.  So a log line here re-enters ``emit``, whose ``finally``
    # releases the lock while the rotation is still half-done, letting a peer
    # rename the file being rotated.  Nothing under the lock may log.

#: Qualified by the ENCLOSING CLASS, because these are ordinary method names:
#: ``format``, ``flush`` and ``_open`` all belong on plenty of classes that
#: have nothing to do with logging, and exempting them by name alone would
#: hide real silent functions.
#:
#: Matched EXACTLY, against the logging base classes themselves.  It used to be
#: a suffix test -- ``b.endswith(("Handler", "Formatter", "Filter"))`` -- whose
#: own comment claimed the enclosing class was the qualifier.  It was not:
#: measured, ``LCDHandler(BaseHandler)`` and ``LEDHandler(BaseHandler)`` match
#: that suffix, and they are the GUI's per-device handlers, not logging ones.
#: Nothing was wrongly exempt at the time (neither declares any hook in this
#: set), so the suffix test was correct by luck.  Widening the set to the
#: record-handling path is what would have spent that luck: ``_open`` and
#: ``flush`` are entirely plausible on a device handler, and either would have
#: gone silently uncounted under a rule written for ``logging``.
