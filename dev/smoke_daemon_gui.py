"""Daemon-mode smoke — Command bus round-trips over the Unix socket.

Spawns ``dev/_mock_daemon.py`` (the real ``run_daemon`` against a scripted
two-device ``MockPlatform`` fleet) on a throwaway socket, connects a real
``AppProxy``, and asserts three Commands survive the JSON round-trip:

  TEST 1  DiscoverDevices — the 2-device fleet's identity (vid/pid) travels
          intact (compared against an in-process scan of the same SPECS).
  TEST 2  ConnectDevice   — the daemon attaches + handshakes the scripted
          panel and the ConnectResult comes back over the wire.
  TEST 3  SetBrightness   — the command bus mutates connected-device state
          daemon-side and returns ok.

Lifecycle uses only production helpers: ``ipc.wait_for_daemon`` to poll,
``AppProxy`` to dispatch, ``daemon.kill_daemon`` ({"kill": True}) to tear down.
The socket is shared by pointing ``$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` at a tmp dir — the same
mechanism ``ipc.socket_path()`` honours in production — so nothing patches
``ipc`` internals.

  TEST 4  EVENT STREAM — the observe half.  ``AppProxy.events`` opens a
          subscription on the real daemon and a ``ConnectDevice`` dispatched
          afterwards arrives back as a typed ``DeviceConnected`` instance.

TEST 4 is the one that matters for the unified bus: until it passed, a GUI
could not run as a daemon client at all, because both Qt skins build a
``BusBridge(app.events)`` at construction and ``AppProxy`` had no such
attribute.  That single ``AttributeError`` is why ``TRCC_DAEMON=1`` stayed off
by default and the Command bus stayed optional.

``FrameSent.surface`` remains an in-process-only field — a remote client falls
back to re-rendering via ``BuildPreview``, which is a separate increment.
