"""Generate `doc/REFERENCE_COMMANDS.md` from the live Command classes.

Same source of truth, and the same reason, as ``dev/gen_cli_reference.py`` and
``dev/gen_ports_reference.py``: what is hand-written drifts, what is generated
and gated does not.

This page is the one an outside contributor needs most and the one that did not
exist.  ``doc/REFERENCE_CLI.md`` documents one UI's spelling of the contract;
this documents **the contract** — the single surface every UI dispatches
against, and the only thing a new UI (a browser client, a VR panel, a TUI) has
to speak.  Until now that surface was 136 classes with no page at all, while
``doc/TRCC_CONTRACT.md`` — the file whose *name* promises exactly this —
described a ``Trcc`` facade and three Command classes deleted in the cutover.
Someone would have written code against them before finding out.

Derived from ``trcc.ipc.COMMAND_TYPES``, which is the registry the IPC layer
itself dispatches through, so the page cannot advertise a Command that daemon
mode could not run.  Everything on it is introspected: the kind
(Command vs Query), the Result type from the class's own generic base, the
fields with their types and whether they are required, and the docstring.
Nothing is written by hand, so nothing can drift.

Deterministic — grouped by the domain module the Command lives in, sorted
inside each group, no timestamp — so the committed file changes only when the
contract does.
